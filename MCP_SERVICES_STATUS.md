## Using MCP Services

### For AI Development (Claude, Cursor, etc.)
The Magic UI MCP has been configured at `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### For Direct API Access
- FastMCP: `http://localhost:8080/mcp/`
- Individual MCPs: `http://localhost:300X/` (where X is 1-5)
- Gateway: `http://localhost:8000/`

## Note on Magic UI Components
Magic UI components are accessed through:
1. The Magic UI MCP (for AI-assisted development)
2. Direct npm package installation (for manual implementation)

The MCP servers provide backend functionality, not UI components directly.
