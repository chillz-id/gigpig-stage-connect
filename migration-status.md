# MCP Migration Status

## ‚úÖ N8N is Already Working!

**N8N Status**: ‚úÖ **RUNNING & WORKING PERFECTLY**
- **Service**: Running on port 5678
- **API**: Authenticated and responding
- **Workflows**: Active workflow "Google Auth Recovery & User Onboarding" 
- **Integration**: Already has MCP tools (though as stubs)

## Migration Plan

### ‚úÖ **Use Official MCP Servers For:**
- **Supabase**: `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase` (28+ tools)
- **GitHub**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
- **Notion**: `@notionhq/notion-mcp-server`
- **Slack**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack`
- **Puppeteer**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer`
- **Filesystem**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`
- **Brave Search**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search`

### üè† **Keep Local/Custom For:**
- **N8N**: Keep in custom server (already working!)

### ‚ùå **No Official MCP Servers Available For:**
- **Metricool**: No official server found
- **XERO**: No official server found  
- **Canva**: No official server found
- **Perplexity**: No official server found
- **Context7**: No official server found

## Current Custom Server Tools That Are Working:
1. **N8N** - ‚úÖ Running workflows, API working
2. **Taskmaster** - ‚úÖ Full implementation exists
3. **Slack** - ‚úÖ Full implementation exists

## Services That Need Official Servers:
- **Supabase** - 28+ tools vs our 3 stubs
- **GitHub** - Full repo management vs our stubs
- **Notion** - Official implementation vs our stubs
- **Filesystem** - Standardized vs our implementation
- **Puppeteer** - Official browser automation vs our stubs

## Services That Stay Custom (No Official Alternative):
- **Metricool** - Social media analytics (custom needed)
- **XERO** - Accounting (custom needed)
- **Canva** - Design docs (custom needed)
- **Perplexity** - Search (custom needed)
- **Context7** - Library docs (custom needed)

## Hybrid Approach:
- **Official MCPs**: For standardized tools with official support
- **Custom MCP**: For N8N + services without official servers
