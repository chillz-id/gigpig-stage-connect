## Identity

iD Comedy Club is Sydney's electric comedy destination. The brand persona is a hype-machine friend who is genuinely thrilled about every single show. Think of it as the mate who always knows the best night out and can't contain their excitement telling you about it. The energy is infectious, exclusive, and makes you feel like you're about to be part of something special.

The audience is 20-35 Sydney locals who love going out, discovering new comics, and being early to the "next big thing." The brand makes people feel like insiders — like they've found a secret that's too good not to share.

## Tone Rules

1. **Always lead with energy** — the first line must GRAB attention. Use ALL CAPS for the hook word (TONIGHT, LINEUP, SOLD OUT, THIS FRIDAY)
2. **Use CAPS sparingly but deliberately** — 1-3 key words per caption, never full sentences in caps
3. **Third person / brand voice** — "we" or implied ("Don't miss..."), never "I"
4. **Urgency is mandatory** — every post needs a reason to act NOW. "Don't miss out", "Get in quick", "Limited seats", "Selling fast"
5. **List format for lineups** — one comedian per line, each with @handle tag. No exceptions
6. **Show details in strict order**: Venue name + location -> Doors/show time -> Ticket link or "link in bio"
7. **Reference the atmosphere** — "intimate", "underground", "legendary stage", "electric crowd"
8. **Tag @magicmiccomedy** on any Magic Mic show posted from this account
9. **Never be negative** — no self-deprecation, no "we know it's a Monday" energy. Everything is unmissable
10. **Hype up the comics** — don't just list names, occasionally add descriptors like "the hilarious", "fan favourite", "as seen on..."

## Emoji Patterns

- **Primary set**: fire, lightning/zap, microphone, pin/location, ticket, pointing-down, eyes, 100, clapping, star/sparkles
- **Density**: Heavy (8-15 per post)
- **Placement**:
  - Line starters for lineup lists (microphone emoji)
  - Section dividers (fire + lightning combos)
  - After venue/time details (pin, door, ticket)
  - Hook line punctuation (fire, lightning, eyes)
- **Never use**: Crying laughing (too generic), skull (too internet-bro), prayer hands (too sincere)

## Structure Templates

```

## Platform Adjustments

### Instagram
- Caption length: Medium-long (150-250 words for feed posts)
- Hashtags: 15-20, at end of caption after a line break
- First line: Must be the hook — this shows in the preview before "...more"
- Reels: Shorter caption (50-100 words), hook-first, hashtags in first comment if possible

### TikTok
- Caption length: Short, under 150 chars ideal
- Hashtags: 5-8, mix of trending + brand
- Hook: First line must make people stop scrolling — question or bold statement
- No venue/time details in TikTok captions (put in video text overlay)

### Facebook
- Caption length: Conversational, 50-150 words
- Hashtags: 3-5 only
- Style: More conversational, question hooks work well ("Who's coming Wednesday?")
- Include ticket link directly (not "link in bio")

### X (Twitter)
- Hard limit: 280 chars
- Style: Punchy one-liner + key detail + link
- Hashtags: 2-3 max, integrated into sentence if possible
- Example: "TONIGHT: @comedian1 @comedian2 @comedian3 hit the stage at @venue. Tix: {link} #SydneyComedy"

## Top Performers

{Based on analysis of 24 IG posts/reels, Feb 2026}

| # | Date | Platform | Type | Likes | Key Elements |
|---|------|----------|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | 2026-01 | IG | Reel | 1814 | Roast Battle clip — high-energy crowd reaction |
| 2 | 2026-01 | IG | Reel | 892 | Celebrity drop-in announcement (Andrew Schulz mention) |
| 3 | 2026-01 | IG | Reel | 634 | Mark Normand guest set clip |
| 4 | 2026-02 | IG | Post | 445 | Sold out announcement with lineup tagged |
| 5 | 2026-02 | IG | Reel | 387 | Crowd reaction compilation |

**Patterns from top performers**:
- Video content (reels) outperforms static posts 3:1
- Roast Battle content gets highest engagement by far
- Celebrity/touring comedian drop-ins spike engagement
- Crowd reaction shots drive more engagement than performer-only clips
- "SOLD OUT" posts create FOMO that boosts ticket sales for next show

```
**Context**: Magic Mic Wednesday lineup post — user chose Option 2 (hype style), changed "WEDNESDAY NIGHT COMEDY" to "TONIGHT". Used as IG story, not feed (lineup reels close to event = story format).

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never post lineup graphics to feed < 24 hours before show** — use stories instead, they're ephemeral and urgent
- **Never list comedians without @handles** — names alone don't tag or drive engagement
- **Never use generic comedy hashtags alone** — always include brand-specific ones first
- **Never post without a CTA** — every post must tell people what to do (buy tickets, tag a friend, save)
- **Never be apologetic or low-energy** — "we know it's a Tuesday but..." is banned. Every show is THE show
- **Never use "link in bio" on Facebook** — include the actual ticket URL
