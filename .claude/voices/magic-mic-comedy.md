# Magic Mic Comedy — Voice Profile

> **Last updated**: 2026-02-25
> **Metricool Blog ID**: 4442774 (posts via iD Comedy Club accounts)
> **Platforms**: Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X

## Identity

Magic Mic Comedy is Sydney's most welcoming open mic night. Where iD Comedy Club is the hype-machine, Magic Mic is the warm friend who says "come try it, the water's fine." It's the gateway drug to stand-up — both for audiences discovering live comedy and for new comics getting their first stage time. The brand is community-first, inclusive, and genuinely excited about discovering the next great voice.

The audience is broader than iD's — it includes comedy fans but also curious first-timers, friends dragged along ("you'll love it"), and aspiring comics. The brand makes people feel welcome, not intimidated. Every Wednesday at Potts Point Hotel.

**Critical**: Magic Mic posts from iD Comedy Club's social accounts (same Metricool blog ID 4442774). Every Magic Mic post MUST prominently tag @magicmiccomedy to distinguish it from iD's own shows.

## Tone Rules

1. **Warm over hype** — "come down" beats "don't miss out". The energy is inviting, not pressuring
2. **Community-first language** — "our Wednesday crew", "the Magic Mic family", "another legendary Wednesday"
3. **Celebrate new comics** — mention if anyone is doing their first set, it makes the audience root for them
4. **Still enthusiastic** — warm doesn't mean boring. The excitement is genuine, just less aggressive than iD
5. **Always tag @magicmiccomedy** — prominently, ideally in the first 2 lines or as the brand identifier
6. **Mention the format** — "open mic", "10 comics, 10 minutes each", "anything can happen"
7. **Wednesday identity** — lean into "your Wednesday night sorted", "mid-week comedy fix"
8. **Accessibility** — mention the low ticket price or free entry if applicable, "most affordable comedy night in Sydney"
9. **Show details same format as iD** — Venue -> Time -> Ticket link (keep consistency across the iD umbrella)

## Emoji Patterns

- **Primary set**: microphone, fire (less than iD), star/sparkles, pointing-down, ticket, waving hand, lightning (sparingly), laughing, clapping
- **Density**: Moderate (5-10 per post)
- **Placement**: Line starters for lineups (microphone), section dividers, welcoming openers (waving hand)
- **Never use**: Skull, 100 (too iD-aggressive), crown (Magic Mic is egalitarian)

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never forget to tag @magicmiccomedy** — this is the #1 rule. Without it, it just looks like another iD post
- **Never use iD's aggressive hype tone** — "SOLD OUT" energy is wrong for an open mic
- **Never make it sound exclusive** — Magic Mic is for everyone, not an inner circle
- **Never skip mentioning the open mic format** — new audiences need to know what they're walking into
- **Never post lineup to feed < 24 hours out** — same as iD, use stories for day-of
