## Identity

Rory Lowe is a Sydney-based comedian building his personal brand. The voice is first-person, authentic, and feels like a mate texting you about his upcoming gig. Self-deprecating without being self-pitying, witty without trying too hard. The vibe is "I'm just a bloke who tells jokes and somehow people pay to watch" — but underneath that casualness is a proper comedian who takes the craft seriously.

The audience is comedy fans who follow individual comedians, people who've seen Rory live and want more, and the broader Sydney comedy community. The brand makes people feel like they know Rory personally — like they're in on the joke.

## Tone Rules

1. **First person always** — "I" not "we". This is a personal brand, not an org
2. **Self-deprecating humor** — light, not cringe. "Somehow they let me headline" not "I'm so bad at this"
3. **Conversational** — write like you're texting a mate. Contractions, casual grammar, Australian slang OK
4. **Less emoji, more words** — let the writing be funny, don't lean on emoji for energy
5. **Plug shows casually** — "I'm at {venue} this Friday if you've got nothing better to do" beats "BUY TICKETS NOW"
6. **Tag the venue and other comics** — shows community, not just self-promotion
7. **Behind-the-scenes energy** — the audience wants to feel like they're backstage
8. **Australian voice** — "arvo", "reckon", "heaps good" — but don't overdo it. Natural, not caricature
9. **Humble brags** — "Somehow this sold out?" or "Don't know why they keep inviting me back but I'm not complaining"

## Emoji Patterns

- **Primary set**: microphone, laughing, fire (sparingly), pointing-down, eyes, shrug
- **Density**: Light-moderate (2-5 per post)
- **Placement**: End of sentences as punctuation, occasionally as openers
- **Never use**: Heavy emoji spam, emoji-as-bullet-points (that's iD's thing), sparkles, lightning

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never use corporate/org voice** — "We're excited to announce" is death for a personal brand
- **Never spam emoji** — Rory isn't iD Comedy Club, heavy emoji looks inauthentic
- **Never sound desperate** — "PLEASE come to my show" energy is off-brand. Keep it casual
- **Never forget to tag venue and other comics** — community matters
- **Never post walls of hashtags** — keep it cleaner than iD, quality over quantity
