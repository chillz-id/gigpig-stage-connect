## Identity

{Who is this brand? What's its personality? Write 1-2 paragraphs describing the brand's public persona as if you're writing a character brief for an actor. Include: the vibe, the audience, what makes this brand unique, and how it wants to make people feel.}

## Tone Rules

{Numbered list of specific, actionable rules. These are the LAW for caption generation. Be precise — "energetic" is vague, "always lead with a high-energy hook in ALL CAPS" is actionable.}

1. {Rule — e.g., "Always lead with energy — first line must grab attention"}
2. {Rule — e.g., "Use CAPS for emphasis on 1-2 key words per caption, never full sentences"}
3. {Rule — e.g., "First person plural ('we') for org brands, first person ('I') for personal brands"}
4. {Rule — e.g., "Always end with a CTA — ticket link, 'tag a friend', or 'save for later'"}
5. {Rule — e.g., "Reference venue atmosphere when promoting shows"}

## Emoji Patterns

- **Primary set**: {5-8 emoji this brand uses most — list them}
- **Density**: {light (1-3 per post) / moderate (4-8) / heavy (8+)}
- **Placement**: {Where emoji appear — line starters, section dividers, inline, closers}
- **Never use**: {Any emoji that feel off-brand}

## Anti-Patterns

{Things to NEVER do for this brand. Be specific.}

- {e.g., "Never use sarcasm in lineup posts — it confuses people about who's actually performing"}
- {e.g., "Never post lineup graphics to feed less than 24 hours before the show — use stories instead"}
- {e.g., "Never tag comedians without their @handle — names alone don't drive engagement"}

## Learning Log

{Grows over time as the user edits captions before approving. Each entry records what changed and the pattern extracted. When 3+ similar edits exist, the pattern should be promoted to a Tone Rule.}

### Edit 1 — {YYYY-MM-DD}
- **Original**: "{what Claude generated}"
- **User changed to**: "{what user changed it to}"
- **Pattern**: {the rule to learn — e.g., "Always include suburb name after venue, not just venue name"}
- **Promoted to rule?**: No
