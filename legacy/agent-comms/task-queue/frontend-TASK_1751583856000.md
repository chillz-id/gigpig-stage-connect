## DIRECTIVE
'll help you design this comprehensive system and organize it into manageable sections for your AI agents. Let me start by using Taskmaster to break down this massive undertaking into structured tasks.request_planningRequest{   `tasks`: [     {       `title`: `Agent 1: Payment & Financial Systems`,       `description`: `Design comprehensive invoicing system, payment processing, FlexPay integration, financial automation, and consolidated artist payments`     },     {       `title`: `Agent 2: Platform Features & UI/UX`,       `description`: `Implement competitor features, fix UI themes, redesign landing page, integrate Facebook ads, mobile optimization, and core platform improvements`     },     {       `title`: `Agent 3: Agency Management System`,       `description`: `Build complete 360 agency/management system with manager signup, act discovery, deal negotiation, message handling, and artist management`     },     {       `title`: `System Architecture & Integration Planning`,       `description`: `Design microservices architecture, API integrations, real-time sync, and scalability framework`     },     {       `title`: `AI-Powered Features Implementation`,       `description`: `Implement smart matching algorithms, predictive analytics, automated content generation, and marketing automation`     }   ],   `splitDetails`: `This large project needs to be split into 3 main sections for different AI agents to work on overnight: 1) Payment & Financial Systems, 2) Platform Features & UI/UX, 3) Agency Management System`,   `originalRequest`: `Design and implement a comprehensive payment/invoicing system, UI improvements, competitor feature matching, and a complete 360 agency/management system for Stand Up Sydney platform` }ResponseError: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/root/Documents/tasks.json'Strategized alternative solution after taskmaster tool failure0sIt seems the taskmaster tool isn't working properly.
