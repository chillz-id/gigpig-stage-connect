## Advanced Notion Formulas

  if(
    prop("Average Rating") > 4.5 and prop("Total Shows") > 50, 
    "⭐ Premium",
    if(
      prop("Average Rating") > 4.0 and prop("Total Shows") > 20,
      "🌟 Excellent", 
      if(
        prop("Average Rating") > 3.5 and prop("Total Shows") > 10,
        "👍 Good",
        if(
          prop("Average Rating") > 3.0,
          "📈 Developing",
          "⚠️ Needs Improvement"
        )
      )
    )
  )
)

// Revenue Projections Formula
let(
  avgTicketPrice, prop("Historical Avg Ticket Price"),
  expectedCapacity, prop("Venue Capacity") * prop("Historical Fill Rate"),
  costs, prop("Venue Cost") + prop("Performer Costs"),
  grossRevenue, avgTicketPrice * expectedCapacity,
  netRevenue, grossRevenue - costs,
  
  "💰 $" + format(netRevenue) + " (Margin: " + 
  format((netRevenue/grossRevenue)*100) + "%)"
)

// Event Status Dashboard Formula
if(
  prop("Date") < now(), 
  if(prop("Status") == "Completed", "✅ Complete", "❌ Past Due"),
  if(
    dateBetween(now(), prop("Date"), "days") <= 7,
    "🔥 This Week",
    if(
      dateBetween(now(), prop("Date"), "days") <= 30,
      "📅 This Month", 
      "📆 Future"
    )
  )
)
```

### 🎯 Smart Automation Formulas
```javascript
// Auto-assign performer slots based on experience
if(
  prop("Event Type") == "Open Mic",
  "5 min slot",
  if(
    prop("Performer Experience") == "Beginner", "7-10 min slot",
    if(
      prop("Performer Experience") == "Intermediate", "10-15 min slot",
      if(
        prop("Performer Experience") == "Advanced", "15-20 min slot",
        "Headliner: 30-45 min"
      )
    )
  )
)

// Dynamic pricing based on venue and demand
let(
  basePrice, prop("Venue Base Price"),
  demandMultiplier, prop("Historical Fill Rate") + 0.5,
  dayOfWeek, formatDate(prop("Date"), "dddd"),
  weekendBonus, if(dayOfWeek == "Friday" or dayOfWeek == "Saturday", 1.2, 1.0),
  
  "$" + format(basePrice * demandMultiplier * weekendBonus)
)
```
