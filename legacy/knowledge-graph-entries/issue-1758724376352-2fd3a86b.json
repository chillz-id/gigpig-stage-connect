  "description": "Notion MCP is configured as HTTP server at https://mcp.notion.com/mcp but documentation shows it should use npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server@latest command format. Also enableAllProjectMcpServers is not set to true in Claude config.",

    "description": "CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Claude Code stores MCP servers in a GLOBAL top-level mcpServers property in /root/.claude.json, NOT in project-specific configurations. The current global mcpServers is null, which is why no MCP tools are accessible. Solution: Copy entire mcpServers object from /root/agents/.mcp.json to top-level of /root/.claude.json. Notion DOES use HTTP format (along with Context7 and Wix) - the documentation showing command format is outdated.",
