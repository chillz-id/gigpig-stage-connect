  "title": "Solution: N8N Memory Exhaustion Workflow Failures",
  "description": "Solution attempt: Fixed N8N workflows that stopped executing since August 2024 due to JavaScript heap memory exhaustion. Root cause: 8000+ execution records accumulated. Solution: 1) Increased /run tmpfs from 795MB to 2GB via /etc/fstab, 2) Started N8N with NODE_OPTIONS max-old-space-size=2048, 3) Enabled execution pruning with EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true and 7-day retention, 4) Set EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=none to reduce memory usage, 5) Enabled DB_SQLITE_VACUUM_ON_STARTUP=true for cleanup. Fixed GET/POST webhook confusion - Humanitix uses API polling (cron schedule), not webhooks. N8N now running stable with 380MB memory usage, API responding, Humanitix â†’ Notion/Brevo sync restored.",
