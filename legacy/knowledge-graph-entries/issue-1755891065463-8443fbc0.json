  "description": "During N8N Humanitix workflow creation, N8N API rejected workflow deployment with error 'request/body must NOT have additional properties'. Root cause: Extra metadata fields in workflow JSON including staticData: null, meta: null, pinData: {}, versionId: null, triggerCount: 0, tags: []. N8N API validation requires clean workflow structure without these optional metadata fields. Required multiple deployment attempts and debugging to identify cause.",

Removed staticData, meta, pinData, versionId, triggerCount, and tags fields from workflow JSON.
