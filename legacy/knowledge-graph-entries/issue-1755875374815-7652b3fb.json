  "title": "Linear Issue Status Discrepancy - Doubting Verified Work",
  "description": "Critical mistake: Initially doubted that BACKEND-40 through BACKEND-44 existed in Linear when user questioned their presence, despite having completed and verified the work myself. Root cause: Failed to verify Linear state before making claims about completed work. This led to unnecessary investigation and could have caused confusion about work completion status. The issues DID exist and were properly tracked. Solution applied: Verified actual Linear state using GraphQL API and confirmed all 5 issues existed with proper status. Prevention: Always verify system state before making assumptions, even about your own previous work. Use ./kg-check or direct API calls to confirm status before responding to user questions about work completion.",
