  "title": "N8N OAuth Callback Endpoint Returns Not Found Despite Correct Configuration",
  "description": "N8N 1.107.3 with HTTPS proxy shows OAuth callback URL as 'https://harrys.standupsydney.com/rest/oauth2-credential/callback' in the interface, but this endpoint consistently returns 404 Not Found during Google OAuth flows. Issue persists despite: correct HTTPS setup via Nginx proxy, proper environment variables (N8N_PROTOCOL=https, N8N_HOST=harrys.standupsydney.com, WEBHOOK_URL=https://harrys.standupsydney.com/), standard port mapping (5678:5678), and REST endpoint configuration (N8N_ENDPOINT_REST=rest).",

    "description": "CRITICAL: DNS misconfiguration identified. Domain harrys.standupsydney.com resolves to AWS CloudFront IPs (3.33.251.168, 15.197.225.128) instead of DigitalOcean server IP (170.64.129.59). N8N REST API works locally (returns 401/200) and Nginx proxy config is correct. Solution: Update DNS A record for harrys.standupsydney.com to point to 170.64.129.59",
