  "title": "Python Script Implementation Patterns and Code Architecture",
  "description": "Need comprehensive documentation of Python script implementation patterns and code architecture for Humanitix sync solution. This includes: 1) Script Structure Patterns - modular function design (sync_event, sync_order, sync_ticket), configuration management approach, separation of concerns between API calls and data transformation, 2) Error Handling Implementation - try-catch patterns for individual record processing, graceful degradation strategies, error logging and reporting mechanisms, 3) Data Transformation Patterns - API response parsing strategies, nested object navigation with defensive programming, type conversion and validation approaches, 4) Rate Limiting Implementation - time.sleep(0.3) strategy for API compliance, batch processing patterns, progress tracking mechanisms, 5) Configuration Management - environment variable usage, API key security practices, database ID management, 6) Testing and Validation - data validation strategies, success/failure tracking, output formatting for monitoring. Essential for code maintainability, future enhancements, and team onboarding to the codebase.",

    "description": "Documented comprehensive Python implementation patterns: SCRIPT STRUCTURE - Modular design with dedicated functions: sync_event() for event metadata, sync_order() for customer data, sync_ticket() for individual tickets. Configuration centralized at script top with API keys, database IDs, headers. Clean separation between API calls (get_humanitix_*) and data sync (sync_*) functions. ERROR HANDLING - Individual record try-catch blocks prevent single failures from stopping entire sync. Error counting and reporting with stats dictionary tracking successes/failures. Graceful degradation with continue-on-error approach for bulk operations. DATA TRANSFORMATION - Defensive programming with nested .get() chains for API response parsing. Type-safe transformations with explicit defaults for missing data. Complex nested navigation: totalsV2.fees.rebate.totalFee.total.afterTax with full null checking. RATE LIMITING - 0.3s delay between API calls using time.sleep() for Notion API compliance. Progress tracking with enumerated processing and status updates. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT - Environment-ready design with centralized constants (HUMANITIX_API_KEY, NOTION_TOKEN, database IDs). Secure header construction for different APIs (x-api-key vs Bearer token). VALIDATION - Success validation with response status checks and ID return verification. Statistics tracking for monitoring (events/orders/tickets synced, errors encountered). Proven production-ready with successful sync showing venue names and  fee rebates.",
