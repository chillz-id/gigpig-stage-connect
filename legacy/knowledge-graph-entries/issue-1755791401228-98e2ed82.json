  "severity": "critical",
  "title": "Startup Protocol Violation - Mandatory Check Skipped",
  "description": "Failed to run mandatory startup check 'node scripts/claude-startup-check.js' at session beginning as required by CLAUDE.md. This led to protocol violations throughout the session: no knowledge graph queries before actions, no issue logging during work, and missed historical context. Only discovered after user requested knowledge graph analysis.",

  "solution": "Fixed startup script file path issues that were preventing proper MCP and environment file reading. Changed '.mcp.json' to '/root/agents/.mcp.json' and '.env' to '/root/agents/.env' in claude-startup-check.js. Script now correctly reports MCP servers 15/15 ready (100%) and finds Supabase credentials. Only remaining issue is Supabase Personal Access Token for MCP tools which is separate environment variable issue.",
