  "title": "Historical MCP Configuration Entries Superseded",
  "description": "NOTICE: Several Knowledge Graph entries from 2025-09-24 contain outdated information about MCP configuration using enableAllProjectMcpServers. This approach was superseded by the critical discovery that Claude Code does NOT resolve environment variable placeholders. The correct solution documented in issue-1758729919603-971e0840 is to replace ALL  placeholders with actual token values in /root/.claude.json. Affected entries: issue-1758686310268, issue-1758694600856, issue-1758724376352.",
