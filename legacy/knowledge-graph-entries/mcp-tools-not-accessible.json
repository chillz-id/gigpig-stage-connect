  "date": "2025-08-08",
  "symptoms": [
    "MCP tools like list_tables return 'No such tool available'",
    "execute_sql, create_issue, send_message tools not accessible",
    "Claude Code can't access any MCP functionality",
    "API calls work directly but MCP tools don't"

  "root_cause": {
    "primary": "Missing Supabase Personal Access Token",
    "details": "MCP servers require specific Personal Access Tokens (different from API keys) to start. Without proper tokens, MCP servers fail to initialize, making all tools unavailable.",

  "solution": {
    "description": "Fixed MCP configuration by correcting placeholder syntax from {{}} to ${} format and adding missing API key placeholders to .env file. Xero credentials were corrected to use proper environment variable syntax. Added empty placeholders for OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, LINEAR_API_KEY, and BRAVE_API_KEY. MCP configuration now properly references environment variables.",
