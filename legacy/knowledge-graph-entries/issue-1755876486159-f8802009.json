  "title": "Agent Task Distribution Efficiency Gap",
  "description": "During parallel agent deployment, noticed potential efficiency improvement: could have distributed security scanning tasks more granularly (e.g., one agent per file type: .js, .json, .py, .env) instead of broader domain assignments. Current approach worked but could be optimized for similar large-scale remediation tasks.",
