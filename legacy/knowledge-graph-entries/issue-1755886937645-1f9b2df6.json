  "title": "Old Config Backup File Accumulation",
  "description": "Low maintenance issue: Multiple old configuration backup files accumulated without cleanup procedures - '.claude.json.backup' (101KB), '.env.production.backup', and '.ssh/known_hosts.old'. Root cause: Backup files created during system updates and configuration changes without lifecycle management or cleanup procedures. While not critical, these files clutter the system and can cause confusion about active configurations. Prevention: Implement backup file lifecycle management with automatic cleanup of old config backups while preserving essential backup files like .env.local.backup.",
