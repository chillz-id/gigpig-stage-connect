  "description": "4 recent orders found (including 2025-08-22T12:35:35.694Z from event 689d8a3c9e771b6de8e3bc0e) should be within 24h window but workflow execution #584 still fails with error status. API testing confirms orders exist and should be captured by 24h filter, but workflow continues to hit errors during processing preventing Notion sync.",

All fixes deployed to N8N workflow XQ8bFr8gSIOQjWC5. Enhanced logging will provide detailed diagnostics in next execution at 21:30. Expecting 4 recent orders to sync successfully after these fixes.",
