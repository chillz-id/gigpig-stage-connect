  "description": "Initially encountered 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to access N8N API at localhost:5678/api/v1. The issue was due to incorrect header format - N8N API requires 'X-N8N-API-KEY' header format instead of Authorization Bearer token. Also discovered that N8N container needed restart after environment variable updates to properly load new API keys.",
