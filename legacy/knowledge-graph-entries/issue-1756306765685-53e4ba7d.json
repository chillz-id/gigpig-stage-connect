  "title": "Humanitix API Integration Patterns and Best Practices",
  "description": "Need comprehensive documentation of API integration patterns and best practices discovered during Humanitix implementation. This includes: 1) Humanitix API Quirks and Behaviors - undocumented API behaviors discovered during implementation, parameter naming conventions (pageSize vs limit), nested response structures requiring deep navigation, authentication header requirements (x-api-key vs Bearer token), 2) Data Structure Navigation Patterns - defensive programming techniques for nested objects (totalsV2.fees.rebate.totalFee.total.afterTax), null-safe traversal strategies, optional field handling patterns, complex object flattening approaches, 3) API Error Handling Strategies - HTTP status code interpretation, rate limiting detection and response, partial failure recovery, timeout and retry mechanisms, 4) Pagination and Data Volume Management - optimal page size selection (events: 10, orders: 50, tickets: 100), memory-efficient processing of large datasets, cursor vs offset pagination patterns, 5) Authentication and Security Patterns - API key management best practices, header configuration for different services, credential isolation strategies, secure token storage. Essential for establishing standard practices for external API integrations and avoiding common pitfalls in API consumption.",
