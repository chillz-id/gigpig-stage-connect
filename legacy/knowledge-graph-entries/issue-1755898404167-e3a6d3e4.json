  "title": "N8N Orders Workflow Successful Execution But Zero Notion Entries",
  "description": "Execution #591 (21:30) completed with status: 'success' and finished: true - first successful execution after workflow fixes. However, Notion database 1374745b-8cbe-804b-87a2-ec93b3385e01 still contains 0 orders despite 4 recent orders existing in Humanitix API (event 689d8a3c9e771b6de8e3bc0e). This suggests workflow processes successfully but orders are filtered out, not transformed correctly, or Notion API calls are failing silently. Enhanced logging should reveal exact cause.",
