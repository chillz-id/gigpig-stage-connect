  "title": "N8N Port Configuration Conflict With OAuth Routes",
  "description": "Initial N8N HTTPS setup used N8N_PORT=443 which caused OAuth callback routes to not register properly. When N8N runs internally on port 443 but Docker maps 5678:443, OAuth endpoints become inaccessible. Fixed by removing N8N_PORT variable and using standard 5678:5678 mapping, but OAuth callback still fails. This suggests OAuth routing issues run deeper than port configuration.",
