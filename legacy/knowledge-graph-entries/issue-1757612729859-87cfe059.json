  "title": "MCP Configuration Location Discovery and Fix Attempt",
  "description": "BREAKTHROUGH: Discovered that Claude Code reads MCP configuration from /root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json NOT from /root/agents/.mcp.json. This explains why MCP tools weren't accessible despite correct configuration. ACTIONS TAKEN: 1) Copied all 12 MCP server configurations from /root/agents/.mcp.json to /root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json, 2) Preserved all environment variable references () to keep API keys secure, 3) Maintained all working API tokens from backup. CURRENT STATUS: Configuration is now in correct location but MCP tools still not accessible - may require Claude Code restart or additional environment setup. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Wrong configuration file location was the primary issue.",
