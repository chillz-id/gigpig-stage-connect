  "description": "Critical architectural failure: Zero user profiles existed in production database despite users being registered. Root cause: Missing handle_new_user database trigger causing complete profile system breakdown affecting ALL users. Multiple commits on July 8-9 attempted to fix symptoms (profile picture uploads) instead of root cause. Prevention: Always validate database fundamentals before debugging UI issues. Implement automated database integrity checks.",
