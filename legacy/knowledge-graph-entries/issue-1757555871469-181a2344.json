  "title": "Solution: MCP Configuration Changes Reverted",
  "description": "Solution attempt: Successfully reverted all MCP configuration changes that broke the setup. Root cause was: 1) Changing SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN to use service key instead of personal access token, 2) Converting working API tokens to environment variables without verification. Restored configuration uses working GitHub, Notion, Slack, Metricool, Xero, and Apify tokens from backup. Supabase still needs Personal Access Token (sbp_ format). MCP tools remain inaccessible in Claude Code sessions due to known limitations, not configuration issues.",
