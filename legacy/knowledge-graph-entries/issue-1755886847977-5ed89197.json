  "title": "System Cache Accumulation Causing Disk Space Waste",
  "description": "High system maintenance issue: System cache directory '/root/.cache/' accumulated 3.5GB of outdated data causing significant disk space waste on production droplet. Root cause: No automatic cache cleanup configured, allowing various application caches to accumulate indefinitely. This reduces available disk space and can impact system performance. Prevention: Configure automatic cache rotation and establish periodic cache cleanup procedures. Consider implementing cache size limits and age-based cleanup policies.",

    "description": "Successfully resolved system cache accumulation issue. Cleared entire system cache directory '/root/.cache/' using 'rm -rf /root/.cache/*'. Results: System cache reduced from 3.5GB to 4KB (99.9% reduction). Total space recovered: 3.5GB. System functionality verified - all services remain operational and cache directories will be recreated as needed by applications. Established understanding of cache cleanup impact and procedures.",
