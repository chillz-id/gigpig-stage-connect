  "description": "Comprehensive investigation revealed: Environment variables working (N8N has HUMANITIX_API_KEY access), Humanitix API returns 25 events with event 689d8a3c9e771b6de8e3bc0e containing 4 recent orders (including 2025-08-22T12:35:35.694Z), Notion API authentication working, all connectivity verified. Workflow executions #577 (21:00) and #584 (21:15) both show error status despite fixes. Root cause: workflow logic prevented processing of events with actual orders.",
