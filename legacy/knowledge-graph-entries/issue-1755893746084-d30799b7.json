  "description": "Orders workflow configured with wrong Notion database ID. Using 2304745b-8cbe-81cd-9483-d7acc2377bd6 (Ticket Sales) instead of 1374745b-8cbe-804b-87a2-ec93b3385e01 (Attendees/Sales). This caused Notion nodes to fail as they were trying to write order data to wrong database. Root cause of 'Notion nodes not working' issue.",

Also added 24-hour 'since' parameter to Get Orders node for historical data capture. Workflow deployed successfully to N8N.",
