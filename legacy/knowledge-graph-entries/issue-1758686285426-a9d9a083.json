  "description": "SUPERSEDED BY CRITICAL DISCOVERY: The real issue was not configuration location but that Claude Code does NOT resolve environment variable placeholders in MCP configuration. The correct solution is: .mcp.json can contain server definitions with ${VAR} placeholders, but /root/.claude.json must have actual token values, not placeholders.",
