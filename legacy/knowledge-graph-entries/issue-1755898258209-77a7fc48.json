  "severity": "high",
  "title": "N8N Workflow Multi-Event Processing Causes Execution Failures",
  "description": "Orders workflow processes all 25 events sequentially from Humanitix API. When workflow encounters events with 0 orders (most events), Transform Orders node was returning {emptyResult: true} which stopped processing instead of continuing to next event. This pattern caused workflow to hit timeout/processing errors before reaching events with actual orders.",

  "investigation_time": null,
  "solution": {
    "description": "Fixed by comprehensive workflow logic improvements: 1) Changed Transform Orders to return empty array [] instead of stopping workflow when no orders found, 2) Added individual order try-catch error handling to prevent single order failures from stopping entire workflow, 3) Fixed IF New Order condition by removing problematic emptyResult check, 4) Added enhanced logging for debugging. All changes deployed to N8N workflow XQ8bFr8gSIOQjWC5. Workflow now processes all 25 events without stopping at first empty event.",
