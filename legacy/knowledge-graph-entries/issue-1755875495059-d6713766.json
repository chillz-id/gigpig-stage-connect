  "title": "Incomplete File Reference Updates After Renaming",
  "description": "Process mistake: When renaming JavaScript files to .cjs extension to fix module issues, didn't initially update all helper script references comprehensively. Root cause: Performed file renames without systematic search and replace across all dependent files, leading to broken script execution when helper commands tried to call renamed files. This caused system-status and other helper commands to fail. Solution applied: Updated all helper scripts (system-status, analyze-task, check-duplicates) to reference correct .cjs file extensions. Prevention: File renames require comprehensive dependency updates across entire system. Use systematic search for file references before renaming. Create a checklist for file rename operations that includes updating all dependents.",
