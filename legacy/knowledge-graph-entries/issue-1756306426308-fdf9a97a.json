  "title": "Fee Rebate Field Missing for Quantity Calculation",
  "description": "User required fee rebate field from Humanitix API for quantity calculations in Notion, showing  per ticket. Initial attempts looked at wrong API fields and export data. Root cause: Fee rebate is nested deep in API response at totalsV2.fees.rebate.totalFee.total.afterTax path, not in obvious top-level fields. This field is critical for financial tracking and quantity calculations in the comedy platform ticketing system. Required proper API endpoint extraction, not export data processing.",

    "description": "Successfully resolved by extracting fee rebate from correct API path totalsV2.fees.rebate.totalFee.total.afterTax in Humanitix ticket data. Implemented proper nested object access in /tmp/humanitix-sync.py sync_ticket() function. Code: fee_rebate = ticket['totalsV2']['fees']['rebate']['totalFee']['total']['afterTax'] if ticket.get('totalsV2', {}).get('fees', {}).get('rebate', {}).get('totalFee', {}).get('total', {}).get('afterTax') else 0. Result: Successfully shows  fee rebate per ticket for quantity calculations. Critical insight: Humanitix uses complex nested financial structure, not simple top-level fields.",
