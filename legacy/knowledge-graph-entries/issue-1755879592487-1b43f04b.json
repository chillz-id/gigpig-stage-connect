  "title": "Humanitix API Header Incorrectly Documented as Bearer",
  "description": "Created N8N credentials cheat sheet incorrectly documenting Humanitix as using 'Authorization: Bearer' format when it actually uses 'x-api-key' header. This error could have caused authentication failures and debugging time. Humanitix OpenAPI spec at /root/HUMANITIXopenapi.yaml clearly shows x-api-key authentication. Actual N8N workflows also confirm x-api-key usage.",

    "description": "Corrected cheat sheet to show Humanitix uses 'x-api-key' header, not 'Authorization: Bearer'. Verified against OpenAPI spec and actual N8N workflow backups. Also verified other API authentications (Brevo, Anthropic, Firecrawl) were correctly documented. Updated /root/agents/n8n-credentials-cheatsheet.md with accurate header formats.",
