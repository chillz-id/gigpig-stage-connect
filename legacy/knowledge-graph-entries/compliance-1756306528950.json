    "description": "Documented comprehensive future maintenance and enhancement strategy: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT - Move /tmp/humanitix-sync.py to production environment with secure credential management from /opt/standup-sydney-mcp/.env. Implement scheduled execution via cron job or systemd timer (hourly/daily based on requirements). Add structured logging with rotation and monitoring integration. Configure production database connections and error alerting. MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES - Implement data consistency validation by comparing Humanitix API totals with Notion database counts. Establish database backup procedures for Notion export and recovery. Set up API key rotation procedures with zero-downtime credential updates. Configure error monitoring with email/Slack notifications for sync failures. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION - Database indexing on Event ID and Order ID fields for faster cross-database queries. Memory optimization through batch processing and streaming for large datasets. API rate limit management with dynamic delay adjustment based on response headers. Scaling through parallel processing of independent events with thread pools. EXTENSION POINTS - New endpoint integration pattern: add get_humanitix_* function, create sync_* function, extend main() loop. Additional platforms: replicate architecture for Eventbrite, Universe, other ticketing APIs. Schema extensions: follow established field mapping patterns (API → Notion property types). Data quality automation: add validation functions for mandatory fields and data integrity. INTEGRATION DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS - Established architecture: API client → data transformation → database sync with error handling. Testing strategy: mock API responses, validate data transformations, verify database integration. Rollback procedures: maintain previous sync states, implement data versioning for recovery. Version control: feature branches for enhancements, staging environment for validation. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS - Check-in data integration via /v1/events/{id}/checkins endpoint, customer journey tracking across multiple events, automated financial reconciliation with comedy platform payments, real-time sync via webhooks instead of polling. PROVEN FOUNDATION - Current implementation successfully handles venue mapping, fee rebate extraction, 3-database architecture. Ready for production deployment with monitoring and scaling capabilities.",
