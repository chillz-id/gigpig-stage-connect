  "description": "Implemented comprehensive 3-database architecture for Humanitix data in Notion: 1) Events Database (25c4745b-8cbe-81e1-9188-d946340bd993) with all API fields from /v1/events endpoint including venue, pricing, dates, classification, 2) Attendees Database (1374745b-8cbe-804b-87a2-ec93b3385e01) for order/customer data with relations to events, 3) Individual Tickets Database (25c4745b-8cbe-8181-950b-c5d04a77e2c6) with detailed ticket info including fee rebate field and relations to both events and orders. Database schemas created via /tmp/create-events-db.json, /tmp/create-attendees-db.json, /tmp/create-tickets-db.json with complete field mappings for Humanitix API structure.",

    "description": "Successfully implemented complete 3-database architecture with proper relations and all API field mappings. Created comprehensive Python sync script /tmp/humanitix-sync.py with functions: sync_event(), sync_order(), sync_ticket() that handle all data transformation and Notion API calls. Key achievements: 1) All Humanitix API endpoints mapped to appropriate Notion properties, 2) Proper database relations established between Events, Orders, and Tickets, 3) Rate limiting implemented for Notion API (0.3s between calls), 4) Error handling and status reporting, 5) Successful data validation showing venue names and  fee rebates. Architecture supports full comedy platform event management with detailed financial tracking and customer data.",
