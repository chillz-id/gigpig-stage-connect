  "description": "Critical security vulnerability: Hardcoded Supabase public API key exposed in /root/agents/src/integrations/supabase/client.ts source code. This creates direct API key exposure risk and potential security breach. Root cause: API key hardcoded in source instead of using environment variables. Prevention: Always use environment variables for API keys and secrets. Implement automated security scanning to catch hardcoded credentials.",
