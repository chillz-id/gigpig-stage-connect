  "title": "N8N Notion Integration Error - Undefined Property",
  "description": "Notion 'Check Order Duplicates' node fails with 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading replace)' error. This suggests data transformation issue where expected property is undefined/null. Occurs after successful Humanitix API calls and Transform Orders step. Need to investigate Transform Orders output structure and Notion node property mappings.",

  "solution": {
    "description": "Fixed by updating Notion node filter expressions from '$json.orderId' to '$('Transform Orders').item.json.orderId' and similar for Events workflow. N8N expression syntax requires explicit node reference when accessing transformed data properties. Updated both workflow-1-clean.json and workflow-2-clean.json and redeployed to N8N. Next scheduled execution should validate the fix.",
