  "description": "Workflow displays long MongoDB ID (686cf02c25fff6460b2e7893) in Order ID field instead of customer-friendly orderName (9Q8QX2LW). This confuses staff and customers who recognize the short codes from Humanitix.",

    "description": "Fixed by changing Order ID field from 'orderId' to 'order.orderName || orderId' in toNotionProperties function. This displays customer-friendly codes like 9Q8QX2LW while keeping internal matching with long IDs. Updated workflow saved at /tmp/fixed-workflow-dates.json includes both date and order ID fixes.",
