  "title": "Database Corruption - Quantity Set to 1",
  "description": "CATASTROPHIC: Database Accuracy Monitor workflow corrupted hundreds/thousands of Notion records by setting quantities to 1. Caused by: 1) Invalid N8N merge mode 'waitForAll' 2) Untested filter 'Ticketing Partner=Humanitix' returning zero results 3) Auto-reconciliation creating duplicates with quantity fallback to 1 4) Not testing before production 5) Multiple failed fix attempts. ALL monitoring workflows DISABLED. Requires backup restore or manual quantity recovery from Humanitix API.",

    "description": "Successfully deployed user-provided fixed N8N workflow that uses tickets endpoint for accurate quantities (each ticket = 1 seat) instead of order quantities. Workflow now upserts by Order ID with backfill mode enabled from 2024-01-01 to fix historical data. Multiple successful executions confirmed via N8N logs showing workflow running every 2 minutes. This replaces the broken Database Accuracy Monitor that was corrupting Notion records.",
