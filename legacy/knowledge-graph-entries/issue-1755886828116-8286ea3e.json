  "title": "NPM/NPX Cache Accumulation Causing Disk Space Waste",
  "description": "Critical system maintenance issue: NPM cache accumulated 4GB+ of disk space with NPX cache consuming additional 1.4GB, causing unnecessary disk usage on production droplet. Root cause: No regular cache maintenance procedures implemented, allowing caches to grow indefinitely. This impacts disk space efficiency and system performance. Prevention: Implement regular cache cleanup schedule using 'npm cache clean --force' and periodic NPX cache clearing. Consider automated monthly cache maintenance.",

    "description": "Successfully resolved NPM/NPX cache accumulation issue. Cleared NPM cache using 'npm cache clean --force' and removed entire NPX cache directory '/root/.npm/_npx/'. Results: NPX cache reduced from 1.4GB to 4KB (99.7% reduction), NPM cache completely cleared. Total space recovered: ~4GB. System functionality verified - NPM still works correctly (v10.8.2). Established procedure for regular cache maintenance to prevent future accumulation.",
