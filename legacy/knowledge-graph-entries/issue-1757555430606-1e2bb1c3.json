  "description": "Solution attempt: Attempted to execute doors_time column migration via multiple API approaches. Confirmed that Supabase REST API does not support DDL operations (ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX). Attempted: 1) Supabase client with rpc, 2) Direct REST API calls, 3) Admin endpoint (404). Schema check shows start_time and end_time columns exist, but doors_time is missing. Manual execution via Supabase SQL Editor remains the only viable option for DDL operations.",
