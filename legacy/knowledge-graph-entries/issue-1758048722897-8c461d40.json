  "title": "Event Date Wrong in N8N Workflow",
  "description": "Workflow using event.startDate instead of order.eventDate for multi-session events like Magic Mic Comedy (every Wednesday). This shows first date of event series instead of specific session date for ticket. Order object has eventDate field with correct session date.",

  "solution": {
    "description": "Fixed by changing eventStartDate logic from 'event?.startDate || event?.startDateTime || event?.date || event?.dates?.[0]?.startDate' to 'order.eventDate || event?.startDate || event?.dates?.[0]?.startDate'. This prioritizes order-specific eventDate field first. Fixed workflow saved at /tmp/fixed-workflow-dates.json ready for deployment. API authentication issues prevent immediate deployment.",
