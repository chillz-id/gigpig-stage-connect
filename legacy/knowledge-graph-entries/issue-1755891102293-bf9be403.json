Root cause: Incorrect parameter formatting and problematic jq piping in curl commands for N8N API calls. Issues included improper escaping of JSON data, malformed curl parameter structure, and incorrect use of jq for data processing. Required multiple command reformulations to achieve successful API calls.",
