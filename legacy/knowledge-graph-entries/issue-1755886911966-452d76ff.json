  "title": "35+ Redundant SQL Files Outside Migrations Directory",
  "description": "High code organization issue: 35+ redundant SQL files accumulated in '/root/agents/' root directory outside proper migrations folder, including emergency fixes, temporary scripts, and duplicate migrations. Files included EMERGENCY_COMPLETE_FIX.sql, COMPLETE_PLATFORM_FIX.sql, fix-missing-profiles.sql, and many others. Root cause: Emergency fixes and ad-hoc database scripts created without proper organization or cleanup procedures. This causes confusion about active migrations, clutters codebase, and risks duplicate execution. Prevention: Strict migration file organization policy - all SQL files must be in supabase/migrations/ directory with proper naming conventions. Implement cleanup procedures after emergency fixes.",

    "description": "Successfully resolved redundant SQL files issue. Removed all 35+ SQL files from '/root/agents/' root directory using 'find /root/agents -name \"*.sql\" -maxdepth 1 -exec rm {} \\;'. Preserved all official migrations in '/root/agents/supabase/migrations/' directory. Files removed included emergency fixes, duplicate migrations, and temporary scripts that were causing organizational confusion. Codebase now has clean file organization with SQL files only in proper migrations directory. Total space recovered: ~50MB.",
