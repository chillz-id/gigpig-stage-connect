  "description": "After fixing incorrect Humanitix API documentation, failed to immediately log the error and solution in Knowledge Graph. This violates the core principle of the Knowledge Graph system - capturing ALL mistakes to prevent repetition. Only logged it after user pointed out the failure. This meta-error shows a pattern of not using the Knowledge Graph system consistently.",

    "description": "Immediately logged both the original Humanitix documentation error and this meta-error to Knowledge Graph. Reinforced the critical practice: ALWAYS log errors and solutions immediately after resolution, not just when explicitly asked. Every mistake, no matter how small, must be captured to prevent repetition across Claude sessions.",
