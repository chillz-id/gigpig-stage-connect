  "title": "ES Module vs CommonJS Configuration Errors",
  "description": "Technical mistake: Created Node.js files using require() statements that failed to run due to package.json 'type': 'module' setting. Root cause: Didn't account for project's ES module configuration affecting CommonJS require() statements, leading to ReferenceError: require is not defined errors. This caused comprehensive tracking system components to fail on execution. Solution applied: Renamed problematic JavaScript files to .cjs extension and updated all references in helper scripts. Updated imports appropriately for module system. Prevention: Always check package.json module configuration before creating Node.js scripts. Verify module system compatibility during development. Test scripts immediately after creation to catch module issues early.",
