  "description": "Enhanced Knowledge Graph script had bug where 'solution' parameter was undefined, causing 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading toLowerCase())' error. Had to work around by logging issues individually instead of using bulk solution logging feature.",

    "description": "Fixed solution logging script error in enhanced-claude-graph-integration.js. Added null/undefined safety checks and support for both 'title' and 'task' fields in Knowledge Graph entries. The error was caused by compliance entries using 'task' field instead of 'title' field. Updated matching logic to handle different entry types safely with: const entryTitle = e.data.title || e.data.task || ''. Script now works reliably for all Knowledge Graph entry types without toLowerCase errors.",
