  "title": "Humanitix Technical Architecture Patterns and Design Principles",
  "description": "Need comprehensive documentation of technical architecture patterns discovered during Humanitix integration implementation. This includes: 1) API Integration Patterns - 3-endpoint strategy (/v1/events, /v1/events/{id}/orders, /v1/events/{id}/tickets), nested data navigation patterns, defensive programming for complex API responses, 2) Database Design Patterns - 3-database Notion architecture with proper relations, field mapping strategies from API to Notion properties, data transformation patterns for different data types, 3) Error Handling Patterns - rate limiting strategies (0.3s between API calls), retry mechanisms for failed requests, graceful degradation for partial failures, 4) Security Patterns - API key management in production environments, credential isolation between systems, secure token handling, 5) Performance Optimization - pagination handling for large datasets, memory management for bulk operations, rate limiting compliance with API providers. Essential for establishing coding standards and architectural guidelines for future integrations.",
