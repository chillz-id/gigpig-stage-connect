  "title": "MCP Tools Not Accessible Despite Configuration",
  "description": "Claude Code was not exposing MCP tools as callable functions despite proper .mcp.json configuration with 16 servers. SUPERSEDED BY CRITICAL DISCOVERY: The real root cause was that Claude Code does NOT resolve environment variable placeholders like ${SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN} in MCP configuration. Placeholders are read as literal strings, causing authentication failures.",

    "description": "SUPERSEDED SOLUTION: The actual solution was replacing ALL environment variable placeholders with actual token values in /root/.claude.json. Environment variable resolution does NOT work in Claude Code MCP configuration. Placeholders like ${SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN} must be replaced with actual token values like sbp_497ee37f3fda4cab843130b6b85e873e1c4242b3.",
