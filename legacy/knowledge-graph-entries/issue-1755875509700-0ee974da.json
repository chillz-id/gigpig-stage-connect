  "title": "Inadequate Setup Process Error Handling and Validation",
  "description": "Process mistake: Setup script reported test issues as 'normal for first run' without proper validation or clear success/failure indicators. Root cause: Didn't implement robust error handling in setup process, leading to ambiguous status reporting that masked real issues. This prevented immediate identification of module configuration problems. Solution applied: System ultimately worked correctly after module fixes, but setup process needs improvement. Prevention: Setup processes need robust error handling and clear success/failure indicators. Implement proper validation steps. Don't dismiss errors as 'normal' without investigation. Create comprehensive setup validation that clearly indicates system health.",
