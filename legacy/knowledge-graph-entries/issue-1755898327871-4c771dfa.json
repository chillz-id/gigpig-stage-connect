  "description": "All identified workflow logic issues have been fixed and deployed to N8N workflow XQ8bFr8gSIOQjWC5. Enhanced logging added for debugging. Waiting for next scheduled execution at 21:30 to validate fixes. Previous executions #577 (21:00) and #584 (21:15) showed error status, but comprehensive fixes should resolve processing issues. Expecting 4 recent orders from event 689d8a3c9e771b6de8e3bc0e to sync successfully to Notion database 1374745b-8cbe-804b-87a2-ec93b3385e01.",

  "solution": "21:30 execution (#591) completed successfully with status: 'success' and finished: true. This is first successful execution after comprehensive workflow fixes. However, 0 orders appeared in Notion database despite successful workflow completion. This indicates workflow logic fixes resolved execution errors, but there may be remaining issue with actual data processing, Notion API calls, or data filtering logic.",
