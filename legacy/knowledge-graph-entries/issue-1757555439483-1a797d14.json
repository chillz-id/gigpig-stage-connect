  "title": "MCP Supabase Tools Not Available in Claude Code Session",
  "description": "During database migration attempt, discovered that MCP Supabase tools (mcp__supabase__execute_sql, mcp__supabase__list_columns, etc.) are not available in this Claude Code session. Only IDE tools (mcp__ide__getDiagnostics, mcp__ide__executeCode) are accessible. This impacts ability to perform database operations directly. Alternative approaches using Supabase client library were attempted but DDL operations still require manual execution.",
