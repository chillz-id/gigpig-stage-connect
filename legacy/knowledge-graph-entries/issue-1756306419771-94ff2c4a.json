  "title": "Missing Venue Data Mapping in Notion Databases",
  "description": "Venue field was not populating in Notion Events database during Humanitix sync. Root cause: Incorrect field mapping - venue data comes from eventLocation.venueName in Humanitix API response, not from a direct 'venue' field. This prevented proper venue identification for comedy events in databases like 'iD Comedy Club', 'Darlinghurst', etc. Critical for event management and location tracking in the comedy platform.",

  "solution": {
    "description": "Successfully resolved by correctly mapping venue data from eventLocation.venueName field in Humanitix API response. Updated database creation schemas in /tmp/create-events-db.json to include proper venue field mapping. Implemented in both N8N workflow attempts and final Python sync script /tmp/humanitix-sync.py. Result: Venue names now properly display as 'iD Comedy Club', 'Darlinghurst', etc in Notion Events database. Key insight: Humanitix API uses nested eventLocation object structure, not direct venue field.",
