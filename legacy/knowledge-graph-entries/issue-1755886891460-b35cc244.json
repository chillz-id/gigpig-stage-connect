  "title": "Old Backup Directory Accumulation Without Cleanup Policy",
  "description": "Medium maintenance issue: Multiple old backup directories accumulated on droplet without cleanup policy - '/root/claude-backups' (29MB, dated July 11), '/root/n8n-backup-20250802' (116KB), and duplicate N8N security backups consuming 91MB+ total. Root cause: No backup retention policy implemented, allowing backups to accumulate indefinitely without lifecycle management. This causes unnecessary disk usage and backup confusion. Prevention: Establish backup retention policy with automatic cleanup of backups older than specified retention period. Implement backup lifecycle management procedures.",
