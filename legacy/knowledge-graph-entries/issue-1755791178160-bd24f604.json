  "title": "Knowledge Graph Integration Scripts Missing",
  "description": "The knowledge graph infrastructure (Neo4j, Redis, TaskMaster, MCP) was operational but Claude Code could not access it due to missing integration scripts at /root/.claude-multi-agent/scripts/. This caused protocol violations throughout the session despite having a sophisticated knowledge system running.",

    "description": "Created complete integration bridge scripts: claude-graph-integration.js, check-graph-status.js, populate-knowledge-graph.js. These scripts connect Claude Code sessions to the distributed knowledge infrastructure (Neo4j, Redis, TaskMaster, MCP). Successfully tested integration and logged session discoveries.",
