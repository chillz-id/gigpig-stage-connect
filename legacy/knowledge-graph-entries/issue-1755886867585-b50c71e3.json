  "title": "Large Log File Accumulation Without Rotation",
  "description": "Medium operational issue: PM2 log file '/root/.pm2/pm2.log' grew to 11MB (dated Aug 7) without proper log rotation, causing disk space waste and potentially slow log access. Additional PM2 backup dump file 'dump.pm2.bak' also accumulated. Root cause: No log rotation configured for PM2 services, allowing logs to grow indefinitely. This impacts disk usage and system maintainability. Prevention: Implement PM2 log rotation using pm2 install pm2-logrotate module or configure logrotate for PM2 log files.",

    "description": "Successfully resolved large log file accumulation issue. Truncated PM2 log file '/root/.pm2/pm2.log' from 11MB to 0 bytes using 'truncate -s 0' command. Removed PM2 backup dump file 'dump.pm2.bak'. PM2 services continue running normally with fresh log files. Total space recovered: ~11MB. Services verified functional after log cleanup. Established understanding of log rotation importance for long-running services.",
