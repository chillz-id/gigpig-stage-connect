  "title": "N8N REST API Endpoints Not Accessible",
  "description": "All N8N REST API endpoints return 404 Not Found, including /rest/credentials and /api/v1/credentials. This suggests the REST API layer isn't properly exposed or configured. N8N shows OAuth callback URL in interface but the underlying REST infrastructure appears non-functional. May require specific N8N configuration or database initialization to enable REST API access.",
