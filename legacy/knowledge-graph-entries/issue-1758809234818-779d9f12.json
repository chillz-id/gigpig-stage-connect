  "description": "Fixed Notion MCP by correcting configuration approach. Wrong: Using URL-based config https://mcp.notion.com/mcp. Correct: Using NPX command npx -y @notionhq/notion-mcp-server@latest with NOTION_TOKEN. Issue was also caused by two different config files: /root/.claude.json and /root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json needing to match. Solution verified with working tools like mcp__notion__API-post-search and mcp__notion__API-get-self.",
