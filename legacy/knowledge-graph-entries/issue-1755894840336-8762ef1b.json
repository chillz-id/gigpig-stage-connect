  "title": "Solution: N8N Orders Workflow Transform Orders/Check Order Duplicates Failure",
  "description": "Solution attempt: Successfully fixed by adding comprehensive error handling to Transform Orders node and improving empty result handling in IF New Order condition. Added debug logging, try-catch blocks, and proper handling of empty order responses. Workflow now executes successfully (execution 558 finished: true). No orders synced because 24-hour filter correctly excludes older orders. Workflow architecture is working correctly.",
