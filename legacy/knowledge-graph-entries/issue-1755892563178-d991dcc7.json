  "description": "N8N workflows use {{ $env.HUMANITIX_API_KEY }} with authentication: 'none' and manual header configuration. This approach relies on N8N having access to system environment variables. While credentials are configured in N8N UI, the workflows don't reference them directly. Need to verify if environment variable access is working correctly or if credential configuration should be used instead.",
