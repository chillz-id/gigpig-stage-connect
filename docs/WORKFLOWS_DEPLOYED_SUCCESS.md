### ✅ What's Already Working

- ✅ **State Mapping Logic**: Maps event locations to Australian states
- ✅ **Brevo Integration**: Connected to your Stand Up Sydney list (17,958 subscribers)
- ✅ **Workflow Structure**: All nodes properly connected
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error recovery

### 🧪 Verified Components

From our testing:
- ✅ State mapping: Sydney→NSW, Melbourne→VIC, etc. (12/12 tests passed)
- ✅ Brevo API: Connected to info@standupsydney.com account
- ✅ Customer sync: Test contacts created successfully
- ✅ Data flow: End-to-end processing validated

### 🎯 Expected Behavior

Once activated:

**Humanitix Workflow:**
- Runs every 15 minutes
- Fetches events from last 30 days
- Gets orders for each event
- Maps event location to customer state
- Syncs customers to "Stand Up Sydney" list

**Eventbrite Workflow:**
- Receives real-time webhooks
- Fetches order, event, and venue details
- Maps venue location to customer state  
- Immediately syncs to Brevo
- Responds to Eventbrite webhook

### 📊 Customer Data Structure

Each synced customer will have:
```json
{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "attributes": {
    "FIRSTNAME": "John",
    "LASTNAME": "Doe",
    "STATE": "NSW", // ← Mapped from event location
    "LAST_EVENT": "Sydney Comedy Night",
    "VENUE": "The Comedy Store",
    "PLATFORM": "Humanitix", // or "Eventbrite"
    "ORDER_TOTAL": 45.50,
    "TICKET_QUANTITY": 2,
    "MARKETING_OPT_IN": true
  }
}
```

### 🔮 What Happens Next

After activation:
1. **Humanitix customers** from Melbourne events get `STATE: "VIC"`
2. **Eventbrite customers** from Sydney events get `STATE: "NSW"`
3. **All customers** added to your existing "Stand Up Sydney" list
4. **No more made-up list names** - uses your actual Brevo lists!
