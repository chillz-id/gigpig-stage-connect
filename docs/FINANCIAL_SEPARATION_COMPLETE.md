### 💰 **Example Financial Breakdown:**

**Julian Woods: Cancel Me! - $89.80 ticket**
- Subtotal: $89.80

### 🤝 **Partner Deal Flexibility:**

The database now supports different partner arrangements:

**1. "80% minus fees" Partner:**
- Partner gets: (Subtotal - Discounts) × 0.8 - Total Fees
- Example: ($89.80 - $0) × 0.8 - $11.60 = $60.24

**2. "Customer pays fees" Partner:**
- Partner gets: (Subtotal - Discounts) × Partner %
- Example: ($89.80 - $0) × 0.9 = $80.82

**3. Your Revenue:**
- Scenario 1: $89.80 - $60.24 + $2.00 rebate = $31.56
- Scenario 2: $89.80 - $80.82 + $2.00 rebate + $11.60 fees = $22.58
