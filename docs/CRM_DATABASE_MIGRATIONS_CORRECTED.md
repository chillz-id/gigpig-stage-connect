# CRM Database Migrations - Corrected Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Applied
**Affected Tables**: `customer_profiles`, `customer_engagement_metrics`
**Views Created**: `customer_activity_timeline` (materialized view)

---

## Issue Summary

### Original Problem
The initial database migrations (created 2025-10-15 07:00) were applied to the **wrong tables**:
- ❌ Applied to `customers` table (3 test rows)
- ❌ Applied to `orders` table (0 rows)
- ❌ Ignored the real data in `customer_profiles` (9,369 customers)
- ❌ Ignored external platform tables (`orders_htx`, `orders_eventbrite` with 11,864 orders)

### Root Cause
Failed to investigate the actual database architecture before applying migrations. The CRM uses a sophisticated multi-table design with:
- **`customer_profiles`** - Master customer table (9,369 records)
- **`customer_engagement_metrics`** - Pre-computed engagement stats (9,369 records)
- **`customer_emails`** - Email addresses linked to customers (9,369 records)
- **`customer_orders_v`** - Unified VIEW combining `orders_htx` + `orders_eventbrite` (11,864 orders)
- **`customers_flat_v`** - Denormalized customer view
- **`customer_marketing_export`** - Marketing materialized view

The `customers` table with 3 rows was just test data.

## Corrective Actions Taken

### 1. Rollback (Completed 2025-10-15 11:30)
```sql
-- Dropped all incorrect migrations
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_customer_activity_type;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_customer_activity_customer_date;
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS customer_activity_timeline;

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS recalculate_lead_score_on_order_change ON orders;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS calculate_customer_lead_score ON customers;

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS recalculate_customer_lead_score();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS calculate_lead_score();

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_customers_rfm_scores;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_customers_lead_score;

ALTER TABLE customers
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS last_scored_at,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS rfm_monetary,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS rfm_frequency,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS rfm_recency,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS lead_score;
```

### 2. Corrected Migrations (Applied 2025-10-15 11:40)

#### Migration 1: Customer Activity Timeline
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250115100000_create_customer_activity_timeline_correct.sql`

**What It Does**:
- Creates materialized view aggregating orders from **both Humanitix and Eventbrite**
- Links customers via `customer_emails` table (handles multiple emails per customer)
- Uses the `customer_orders_v` unified view
- Includes rich metadata (order amount, event name, status, source, purchaser name)

**Results**:
- ✅ 11,825 order activities captured
- ✅ 9,369 unique customers linked
- ✅ Date range: April 2021 - October 2025
- ✅ Indexes created for efficient querying

**Sample Query**:
```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  activity_type,
  created_at,
  metadata->>'event_name' as event,
  metadata->>'amount' as amount,
  metadata->>'source' as platform
FROM customer_activity_timeline
WHERE customer_id = 'YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

#### Migration 2: Lead Scoring (RFM Model)
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250115100001_create_lead_scoring_correct.sql`

**What It Does**:
- Adds 5 columns to `customer_profiles` table:
  - `lead_score` (INTEGER) - Composite score 6-30
  - `rfm_recency` (INTEGER) - 1-5 scale
  - `rfm_frequency` (INTEGER) - 1-5 scale
  - `rfm_monetary` (DECIMAL) - 1-5 scale
  - `last_scored_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Auto-updated
- Creates triggers to auto-calculate scores on customer or engagement metric changes
- Uses data from `customer_engagement_metrics` table

**Scoring Formula**:
```
lead_score = (recency × 3) + (frequency × 2) + (monetary × 1)
Range: 6-30 (higher = better lead)
```

**Recency Thresholds**:
- 5 points: Last order ≤30 days ago
- 4 points: ≤60 days
- 3 points: ≤90 days
- 2 points: ≤180 days
- 1 point: >180 days

**Frequency Thresholds**:
- 5 points: ≥10 orders
- 4 points: ≥5 orders
- 3 points: ≥3 orders
- 2 points: ≥1 order
- 1 point: 0 orders

**Monetary Thresholds** (based on `lifetime_net`):
- 5 points: ≥$1,000 spent
- 4 points: ≥$500
- 3 points: ≥$200
- 2 points: ≥$50
- 1 point: <$50

**Results**:
- ✅ All 9,369 customers scored
- ✅ Score range: 8-28 (realistic distribution)
- ✅ Average score: 10.06
- ✅ Segmentation:
  - 🔥 Hot Leads (24-30): 20 customers (0.2%)
  - 🟠 Warm Leads (18-23): 653 customers (7.0%)
  - 🟡 Cool Leads (12-17): 1,148 customers (12.3%)
  - ❄️ Cold Leads (6-11): 7,548 customers (80.5%)

## Verification Queries

### Check Activity Timeline
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_activities,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers,
  MIN(created_at) as earliest,
  MAX(created_at) as latest
FROM customer_activity_timeline;

-- Expected: 11,825 activities, 9,369 unique customers
```

### Check Lead Score Distribution
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lead_score >= 24) as hot,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lead_score >= 18 AND lead_score < 24) as warm,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lead_score >= 12 AND lead_score < 18) as cool,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lead_score < 12) as cold,
  ROUND(AVG(lead_score), 2) as avg_score,
  MIN(lead_score) as min_score,
  MAX(lead_score) as max_score
FROM customer_profiles;

-- Expected: 9,369 total, average ~10, range 8-28
```

### View Top Customers
```sql
SELECT
  cp.canonical_full_name,
  ce.email,
  cp.lead_score,
  cp.rfm_recency,
  cp.rfm_frequency,
  cp.rfm_monetary,
  cem.lifetime_orders,
  cem.lifetime_net,
  cem.last_order_at
FROM customer_profiles cp
LEFT JOIN customer_emails ce ON ce.customer_id = cp.id AND ce.is_primary = true
LEFT JOIN customer_engagement_metrics cem ON cem.customer_id = cp.id
WHERE cp.lead_score >= 24
ORDER BY cp.lead_score DESC, cem.lifetime_net DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected: 20 hot leads with high recency/frequency/monetary scores
```

### View Customer Timeline
```sql
SELECT
  activity_type,
  created_at,
  metadata->>'event_name' as event,
  metadata->>'amount' as amount,
  metadata->>'source' as platform
FROM customer_activity_timeline
WHERE customer_id = 'd0a22a8a-7a17-4920-ac26-82712d260257'  -- Top customer
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Expected: Order history with event names and amounts
```

---

## Maintenance Operations

### Refresh Activity Timeline
The materialized view needs periodic refresh to capture new orders:

```sql
-- Manual refresh
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW customer_activity_timeline;

-- Check last refresh
SELECT
  schemaname,
  matviewname,
  last_autovacuum,
  n_tup_ins,
  n_tup_upd
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE relname = 'customer_activity_timeline';
```

**Recommendation**: Schedule daily refresh at 2 AM via N8N workflow or pg_cron.

### Recalculate Lead Scores
Lead scores update automatically via triggers, but you can force recalculation:

```sql
-- Force recalculation for all customers
UPDATE customer_profiles
SET updated_at = NOW();

-- Force recalculation for specific customer
UPDATE customer_profiles
SET updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID';
```

### Monitor Lead Score Changes
```sql
SELECT
  DATE(last_scored_at) as score_date,
  COUNT(*) as customers_scored,
  ROUND(AVG(lead_score), 2) as avg_score
FROM customer_profiles
WHERE last_scored_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE(last_scored_at)
ORDER BY score_date DESC
LIMIT 7;
```

## Integration with CRM UI

### Frontend Components Affected
The following components were built expecting `customers` table but should now query `customer_profiles`:

1. **`src/hooks/useCustomers.ts`** ✅ Already queries correct tables via views
2. **`src/hooks/useCustomerActivity.ts`** ✅ Already compatible (queries by ID)
3. **`src/components/crm/CustomerTable.tsx`** ✅ Works with customer_profiles
4. **`src/components/crm/ActivityTimeline.tsx`** ✅ Compatible with new view

### API Endpoints to Update
No changes needed - Supabase client already queries through views.

### Views to Use in Frontend
- **Customer List**: Query `customers_flat_v` (includes engagement metrics)
- **Customer Detail**: Query `customer_profiles` with joins
- **Activity Timeline**: Query `customer_activity_timeline`
- **Lead Segmentation**: Query `customer_profiles` filtered by `lead_score`

---

## Rollback Procedures (If Needed)

### Rollback Activity Timeline
```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_customer_activity_timeline_type;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_customer_activity_timeline_customer_date;
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS customer_activity_timeline;
```

### Rollback Lead Scoring
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS recalculate_lead_score_on_engagement_change ON customer_engagement_metrics;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS calculate_customer_profile_lead_score ON customer_profiles;

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS recalculate_customer_profile_lead_score();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS calculate_lead_score_for_customer_profiles();

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_customer_profiles_rfm_scores;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_customer_profiles_lead_score;

ALTER TABLE customer_profiles
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS last_scored_at,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS rfm_monetary,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS rfm_frequency,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS rfm_recency,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS lead_score;
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Insufficient Discovery**: Did not investigate actual database schema before coding migrations
2. **Assumption-Based Development**: Assumed `customers` table was the master without verification
3. **No Data Volume Check**: Did not check row counts before applying migrations
4. **Rushed Execution**: Applied migrations without understanding the existing data warehouse architecture

### What Went Right
1. **Quick Detection**: User noticed the 3 vs 9,000+ discrepancy immediately
2. **Clean Rollback**: All incorrect changes removed without data loss
3. **Proper Investigation**: Discovered the real architecture through systematic queries
4. **Correct Implementation**: New migrations work with actual production data
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified data volumes, distributions, and sample records

### Best Practices for Future Migrations
1. **Always investigate schema first**: Use `information_schema` queries
2. **Check row counts**: Verify you're working with production data
3. **Test on sample data**: Run queries before creating migrations
4. **Document architecture**: Understand relationships between tables
5. **Verify existing views**: Check if aggregation logic already exists
6. **Test rollback procedures**: Ensure migrations can be safely undone
