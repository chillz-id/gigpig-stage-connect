## SQL Queries for Reference

### Check Deal Count by Status
```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM deal_negotiations
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY
  CASE status
    WHEN 'proposed' THEN 1
    WHEN 'negotiating' THEN 2
    WHEN 'counter_offered' THEN 3
    WHEN 'accepted' THEN 4
    WHEN 'declined' THEN 5
    WHEN 'expired' THEN 6
  END;
```

### Get Deals with Full Relationships
```sql
SELECT
  dn.id,
  dn.title,
  dn.status,
  dn.proposed_fee,
  artist.first_name || ' ' || artist.last_name as artist_name,
  promoter.first_name || ' ' || promoter.last_name as promoter_name,
  e.title as event_title
FROM deal_negotiations dn
LEFT JOIN profiles artist ON dn.artist_id = artist.id
LEFT JOIN profiles promoter ON dn.promoter_id = promoter.id
LEFT JOIN events e ON dn.event_id = e.id
ORDER BY dn.created_at DESC;
```

### Calculate Pipeline Value
```sql
SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as deal_count,
  SUM(proposed_fee) as total_value,
  AVG(proposed_fee) as avg_value
FROM deal_negotiations
WHERE status IN ('proposed', 'negotiating', 'counter_offered')
GROUP BY status;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### RLS Issues
If deals don't appear:
1. Check user is authenticated
2. Verify user has correct role
3. Check if user ID matches artist_id, promoter_id, or has agency access
4. Temporarily disable RLS for testing: `ALTER TABLE deal_negotiations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`

### Missing Data
If relationships are broken:
1. Verify artist_id exists in profiles table
2. Verify promoter_id exists in profiles table
3. Verify event_id exists in events table (or is NULL for non-event deals)

### Enum Errors
If status updates fail:
- Only use valid enum values (see Database Enum Reference above)
- Check case sensitivity (all lowercase with underscores)
