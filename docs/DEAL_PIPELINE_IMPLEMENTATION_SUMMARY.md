## Architecture

### State Management
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state
- 5-minute stale time, 10-minute cache time
- Optimistic updates on drag-and-drop
- Automatic refetch on window focus
- Query invalidation on mutations

### Component Hierarchy
```
DealPipelinePage
├── Pipeline Metrics (4 cards)
├── DealFilters
└── DealKanbanBoard
    └── DealCard (multiple)
        └── onClick → Opens Dialog with DealNegotiationEngine

DealDetailPage
├── Deal Overview
├── Negotiation History
└── DealNegotiationEngine
```

### Data Flow
1. `useDeals()` fetches all deals from Supabase with joined relationships
2. `DealPipelinePage` filters and sorts deals based on user-selected filters
3. Deals grouped by status and passed to `DealKanbanBoard`
4. User drags card to new column
5. `useUpdateDealStatus()` mutation fires with optimistic update
6. UI updates immediately, then confirms with server
7. On error, rollback with toast notification

## Database Schema

### Table: `deal_negotiations`
```sql
CREATE TABLE deal_negotiations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  deal_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- booking, performance, collaboration, sponsorship
  status TEXT NOT NULL, -- proposed, negotiating, counter_offered, accepted, declined, expired
  artist_id UUID REFERENCES comedians(id),
  promoter_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
  proposed_fee DECIMAL(10,2),
  performance_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  performance_duration INTEGER, -- minutes
  deadline TIMESTAMPTZ,
  notes TEXT,
  priority TEXT, -- low, medium, high
  assigned_to UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  negotiation_stage TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### Required Relationships
- `artist_id` → `comedians` table (stage_name, first_name, last_name)
- `promoter_id` → `profiles` table (first_name, last_name)
- `event_id` → `events` table (title)

### RLS Policies Needed
```sql
-- SELECT: View deals where user is artist, promoter, or assigned
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their deals" ON deal_negotiations
FOR SELECT USING (
  auth.uid() = artist_id OR
  auth.uid() = promoter_id OR
  auth.uid() = assigned_to OR
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles
    WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
    AND profiles.role IN ('admin', 'agency_manager')
  )
);

-- UPDATE: Update deals where user is assigned or admin
CREATE POLICY "Users can update assigned deals" ON deal_negotiations
FOR UPDATE USING (
  auth.uid() = assigned_to OR
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles
    WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
    AND profiles.role IN ('admin', 'agency_manager')
  )
);
```

## Known Limitations

### Missing Features
- ❌ Deal creation flow (planned for Phase 7)
- ❌ Bulk actions (archive multiple, bulk status change)
- ❌ Deal duplication
- ❌ Export to CSV/Excel
- ❌ Advanced search (fuzzy matching, field-specific)

### Performance
- ⚠️ Not tested with >100 deals (may need virtualization)
- ⚠️ No pagination (loads all deals at once)
- ⚠️ No infinite scroll or windowing

### Accessibility
- ⚠️ Drag-and-drop not keyboard accessible
- ⚠️ No ARIA live regions for status updates
- ⚠️ Screen reader support untested

### Mobile
- ⚠️ Drag-and-drop works on desktop only
- ⚠️ Needs touch gesture implementation
- ⚠️ Kanban columns should be horizontally scrollable
- ⚠️ Touch targets should be larger (44x44px minimum)

## Troubleshooting

### "Deal not found" Error
- Check RLS policies on `deal_negotiations` table
- Verify user has access (artist, promoter, or assigned)
- Check if deal exists in database

### Drag-and-Drop Not Working
- Verify `draggable` attribute on card wrapper
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `useUpdateDealStatus` mutation is defined
- Test with different browsers (drag-and-drop has quirks)

### Filters Not Working
- Check if filters are passed correctly to parent
- Verify filter logic in `DealPipelinePage`
- Test with console.log to debug filter values

### Modal Not Opening
- Check if `selectedDeal` state is set correctly
- Verify Dialog component is rendered
- Check if `isNegotiationModalOpen` state updates

### Performance Issues
- Check React DevTools for unnecessary re-renders
- Profile with React Profiler
- Consider virtualizing kanban columns if >50 deals per column
- Add pagination if total deals >100
