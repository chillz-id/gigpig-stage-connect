## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (Day -1)

#### 1. Fix Blocking Issues
```bash
# Fix AuthContext TypeScript errors
# Location: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
# Issues: See test output for details

# Fix CRM ContactCard import
# Location: src/components/crm/ContactList.tsx
```

#### 2. Run Full Test Suite
```bash
cd /root/agents

# Unit tests
npm run test

# Integration tests
npm run test -- tests/integration/

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

#### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Check for build errors
# Verify bundle size is acceptable
```

#### 4. Code Review
- [ ] Review all modified files
- [ ] Verify no debug code left
- [ ] Check console.log statements removed
- [ ] Validate TypeScript types

### Phase 2: Staging Deployment (Day 0 Morning)

#### 1. Database Migrations

```bash
# Connect to staging Supabase
# Apply migrations in order:

# Migration 1: manager_profiles
-- File: supabase/migrations/xxxx_create_manager_profiles.sql
-- Verify: SELECT * FROM manager_profiles LIMIT 1;

# Migration 2: videographer_profiles
-- File: supabase/migrations/xxxx_create_videographer_profiles.sql
-- Verify: SELECT * FROM videographer_profiles LIMIT 1;

# Verify RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('manager_profiles', 'videographer_profiles');
```

#### 2. Deploy Frontend to Staging

```bash
# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel staging
vercel deploy --env=staging

# Verify deployment
curl https://staging.standupsyney.com
```

#### 3. Smoke Tests on Staging

- [ ] Navigate to https://staging.standupsydney.com
- [ ] Log in with test account
- [ ] Verify profile switcher visible
- [ ] Create new manager profile
- [ ] Switch between profiles
- [ ] Edit existing profile
- [ ] Delete test profile
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Test on mobile device

#### 4. Performance Testing

```bash
# Run Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse https://staging.standupsydney.com --view

# Check metrics:
# - Performance score > 90
# - Accessibility score > 95
# - Best Practices score > 90
# - SEO score > 90
```

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Day 0 Afternoon)

#### 1. Final Checks

- [ ] All staging tests passed
- [ ] No critical errors in staging logs
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

#### 2. Database Migrations (Production)

```bash
# BACKUP FIRST
# Create full database backup

# Apply migrations
-- Migration 1: manager_profiles
-- Migration 2: videographer_profiles

# Verify
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM manager_profiles;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM videographer_profiles;
```

#### 3. Deploy to Production

```bash
# Merge to main branch
git checkout main
git merge feature/multi-profile-switching
git push origin main

# Deploy to Vercel production
vercel deploy --prod

# Verify
curl https://standupsydney.com
```

#### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

**Immediate Checks (0-15 minutes):**
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Profile switcher visible
- [ ] Can switch profiles
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Mobile view works
- [ ] Check error monitoring (Sentry/equivalent)

**Extended Checks (15-60 minutes):**
- [ ] Create new profile works
- [ ] Edit profile works
- [ ] Delete profile works
- [ ] Profile completion tracking works
- [ ] Profile-specific sidebars render
- [ ] localStorage persistence works
- [ ] No performance degradation

### Phase 4: Monitoring (Day 1-7)

#### Day 1: Active Monitoring

**Metrics to Watch:**
- Error rate (should remain < 1%)
- Profile switch time (should be < 200ms)
- Page load time (should not increase)
- User engagement with profile switcher
- New profile creation rate

**Actions:**
- [ ] Check error logs every hour
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Watch for user reports
- [ ] Track profile switching events

#### Day 2-7: Regular Monitoring

- [ ] Daily error log review
- [ ] Daily performance metrics check
- [ ] Weekly user feedback review
- [ ] Track adoption metrics

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Arise

#### Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes)

```bash
# Revert to previous Vercel deployment
vercel rollback

# OR revert git commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
vercel deploy --prod
```

#### Database Rollback

```sql
-- Drop new tables (if needed)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS manager_profiles CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS videographer_profiles CASCADE;

-- Remove user_roles for new profile types (if needed)
DELETE FROM user_roles WHERE role IN ('manager', 'videographer');
```

#### Considerations
- Users who created manager/videographer profiles will lose that data
- Announce rollback to users
- Investigate issue before re-deploying

## Success Criteria

### Day 1 Success
- ✅ Zero critical errors
- ✅ Profile switching works for all users
- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ No user complaints

### Week 1 Success
- ✅ > 10% of multi-role users try profile switching
- ✅ Average profile completion > 60%

## Appendix

### A. Test User Accounts

For manual testing, create test accounts with:

- User 3: Photographer + Videographer profiles
- User 4: All 5 profile types
- User 5: No profiles (new user)

### B. Rollback Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rollback.sh

echo "Starting Multi-Profile System Rollback..."

# 1. Revert Vercel deployment
echo "Rolling back Vercel deployment..."
vercel rollback

# 2. Check if database rollback needed
read -p "Rollback database migrations? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
echo
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then
    echo "Manual database rollback required."
    echo "Run the SQL commands from the Rollback Plan section."
fi

echo "Rollback complete."
```

### C. Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Check profile creation rate
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as new_profiles
FROM user_roles
WHERE role IN ('manager', 'videographer')
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Check profile switching activity (from logs)
-- Monitor localStorage writes for 'active-profile-type'

-- Check profile completion
SELECT
  role,
  COUNT(*) as total_profiles,
  AVG(completion_percentage) as avg_completion
FROM profile_stats_view -- Create this view if needed
GROUP BY role;
```
