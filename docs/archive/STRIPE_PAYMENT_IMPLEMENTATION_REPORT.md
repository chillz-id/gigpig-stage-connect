  - Shows cancellation message
  - Retry payment option
  - Links back to invoices

#### Stripe Service (`/src/services/stripeService.ts`)
- **Status**: Updated
- **Features**:
  - Payment link creation
  - Payment status checking
  - Payment history retrieval
  - Notification handling

### 4. ✅ Testing Components

- **Test Script** (`test-stripe-payment-link.js`):
  - Creates test invoices if needed
  - Tests payment link creation
  - Verifies database storage
  - Simulates webhook processing

- **Documentation** (`/docs/STRIPE_PAYMENT_INTEGRATION.md`):
  - Complete setup instructions
  - API reference
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Security considerations

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Frontend
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_... (or pk_live_...)

# Backend (Supabase)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (or sk_live_...)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### Stripe Dashboard Setup
1. Create webhook endpoint: `https://[your-project].supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
2. Subscribe to events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`

### Deploy Edge Functions
```bash
supabase functions deploy create-payment-link
supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Secure Payment Links**
   - One-click payment link generation
   - 7-day expiration for security
   - Unique links per invoice

2. **Automatic Status Updates**
   - Real-time payment tracking
   - Invoice status automation
   - Payment history recording

3. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive UI integration
   - Success/failure feedback
   - Mobile-responsive design

4. **Security**
   - User authentication required
   - Permission-based access
   - Webhook signature verification
   - No card data storage

## Testing Workflow

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   node test-stripe-payment-link.js
   ```

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Create/find a sent invoice
   - Click "Pay Link" button
   - Complete test payment (use card 4242 4242 4242 4242)
   - Verify success page and status updates

3. **Webhook Testing**:
   - Use Stripe CLI for local webhook testing
   - Monitor Supabase function logs
   - Check database updates

## Next Steps

1. **Add Stripe API Keys** to environment variables
2. **Deploy Edge Functions** to Supabase
3. **Configure Webhook** in Stripe Dashboard
4. **Test End-to-End** payment flow
5. **Monitor** first production payments

## Notes

- The system supports partial payments
- Payment links expire after 7 days for security
- All amounts are stored in dollars (converted from Stripe's cents)
- Webhook handler includes idempotency checks to prevent duplicate payments
- Success/cancel URLs are configurable per payment link

The implementation is complete and ready for testing once the Stripe configuration is added.
