```

## First User Onboarding Test

   - Verify profile creation
   - Document any issues

2. **Phase 2**: Limited beta (3-5 users)
   - Invite trusted comedians/promoters
   - Monitor closely
   - Gather feedback

3. **Phase 3**: Full launch
   - After successful beta
   - With support ready

## Support Contacts

- Technical issues: Check console logs
- Database issues: Supabase dashboard
- Frontend issues: Check browser console

## Next Steps

1. Run first user signup test
2. Complete manual testing checklist
3. Fix any issues found
4. Begin internal testing phase
