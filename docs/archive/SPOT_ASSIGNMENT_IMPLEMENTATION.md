# Spot Assignment Implementation Summary

## Overview
Updated the application approval flow to automatically assign spots to comedians when their applications are approved. The implementation includes proper error handling, confirmation deadlines, and notification system integration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Added spot confirmation fields to event_spots table:
- `confirmation_status` - Status of comedian confirmation ('pending', 'confirmed', 'declined', 'expired')
- `confirmation_deadline` - Timestamp deadline for confirmation
- `confirmed_at` - When the comedian confirmed the spot
- `declined_at` - When the comedian declined the spot

### 2. Database Functions

#### Spot Assignment Function (`assign_spot_to_comedian`)
- Atomically assigns a comedian to an available spot
- Checks for existing assignments to prevent double-booking
- Sets confirmation deadline (default 48 hours)
- Returns success/failure status with appropriate messages

#### Spot Expiration Function (`handle_expired_spot_confirmations`)
- Finds and processes expired spot confirmations
- Frees up spots that weren't confirmed by deadline
- Sends notifications to both comedian and promoter
- Returns count of expired spots and notifications sent

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### New Hooks

**`useSpotAssignment`**
- Handles spot assignment logic
- Integrates with notification system
- Proper error handling for no available spots
- Success/failure toast notifications

**`useSpotConfirmation`**
- Allows comedians to confirm/decline assigned spots
- Updates spot status accordingly
- Notifies promoters of comedian decisions
- Frees up spots when declined

**`useSpotExpiration`**
- Manages periodic cleanup of expired spots
- Sends reminder notifications
- Automatic cleanup every 30 minutes

#### Updated Hooks

**`useApplications`**
- Modified approval flow to include spot assignment
- Application approval now:
  1. Attempts to assign available spot
  2. Only approves application if spot assignment succeeds
  3. Sends notification to comedian
  4. Proper error handling for no available spots

### 4. Notification System Integration

#### New Notification Types
- `spot_assigned` - When a comedian is assigned a spot
- `spot_confirmed` - When a comedian confirms their spot
- `spot_declined` - When a comedian declines their spot
- `spot_expired` - When a spot assignment expires

#### Notification Templates
- Professional messaging for all spot-related notifications
- Includes event details, deadlines, and action buttons
- Supports both comedian and promoter notifications

### 5. Services

#### Spot Expiration Service
- Singleton service for managing spot expiration
- Periodic cleanup functionality
- Reminder notifications for expiring spots
- Manual cleanup capability

### 6. Error Handling

#### Comprehensive Error Scenarios
- No available spots of requested type
- Comedian already assigned to event
- Database transaction failures
- Network/API errors

#### User-Friendly Messages
- Clear error descriptions
- Actionable feedback
- Proper error propagation

## Application Flow

### When Application is Approved:
1. **Spot Assignment**: Find available spot matching application spot_type
2. **Database Update**: 
   - Set `comedian_id` on event_spots row
   - Set `is_filled` to true
   - Set `confirmation_status` to 'pending'
   - Set `confirmation_deadline` (48 hours default)
3. **Application Update**: Change status to 'accepted'
4. **Notification**: Send notification to comedian with confirmation deadline
5. **Error Handling**: If no spots available, application remains pending

### When Comedian Confirms Spot:
1. **Database Update**: Set `confirmation_status` to 'confirmed'
2. **Notification**: Send notification to promoter about confirmation
3. **UI Update**: Update all relevant queries

### When Comedian Declines Spot:
1. **Database Update**: 
   - Set `confirmation_status` to 'declined'
   - Set `is_filled` to false
   - Clear `comedian_id`
2. **Notification**: Send notification to promoter about decline
3. **Spot Freed**: Spot becomes available for other comedians

### Automatic Expiration:
1. **Periodic Check**: Every 30 minutes, check for expired spots
2. **Cleanup**: Free up expired spots
3. **Notifications**: Send notifications to both comedian and promoter
4. **Status Update**: Set status to 'expired'

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/spotAssignment.test.ts`) covering:
- Spot assignment RPC function calls
- No available spots scenarios
- Already assigned comedian scenarios
- Expired spot cleanup
- Spot confirmation status updates
- Spot decline handling

All tests pass successfully.

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Workflow**: Seamless integration between application approval and spot assignment
2. **Proper Error Handling**: Clear feedback when spots are unavailable
3. **Time-bound Confirmations**: Prevents indefinite spot holds
4. **Real-time Notifications**: Keeps all parties informed
5. **Atomic Operations**: Database consistency through transactions
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Robust test coverage
