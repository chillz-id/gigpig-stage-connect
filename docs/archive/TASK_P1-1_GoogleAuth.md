- `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` - Auth context
- Supabase configuration files

## **‚úÖ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth flow completes successfully
3. User data persists in Supabase `users` table
4. User profile is created with proper role assignment
5. User remains logged in after page refresh

   - Check for any errors in browser console
   - Verify session handling

4. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Test with fresh Google account
   - Verify user data appears in Supabase
   - Test role assignment works
   - Test logout/login persistence

## **üß™ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Clear browser data/use incognito mode

3. Complete Google OAuth flow
4. Check Supabase users table for new entry

## **üìã DEFINITION OF DONE**
- [ ] Google OAuth completes without errors
- [ ] User data persists in Supabase
- [ ] Profile is created with correct role
- [ ] Auth state persists across page refreshes
- [ ] No console errors during auth flow
