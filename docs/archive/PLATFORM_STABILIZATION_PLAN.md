## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### What NOT to Remove/Change:
- ‚ùå Don't remove MCP servers - they're valuable for automation
- ‚ùå Don't replace N8N - fix and enhance it instead  
- ‚ùå Don't build new error handling - use existing KG‚ÜíLinear
- ‚ùå Don't oversimplify - optimize the complexity instead

### What to Focus On:
- ‚úÖ Activate existing automation infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Clean up security issues and technical debt
- ‚úÖ Improve stability without reducing capabilities
- ‚úÖ Document and preserve knowledge for future sessions

### Context Preservation Strategy:
1. Always read platform state JSON before major work
2. Update session notes with key decisions
3. Use tracking scripts to maintain continuity
4. Log all significant changes to Knowledge Graph
