# P1.2: Fix Event Publishing Authentication Error

## **🎯 TASK OVERVIEW**
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocking event publishing
**Component:** Event creation system
**Current Issue:** "Authentication Required. Please log in to create an event" error when publishing

## **🔍 PROBLEM DETAILS**
- User is logged in but gets authentication error
- "Publish Event" button triggers auth error message
- Error notification doesn't auto-dismiss
- Prevents any event publishing functionality

## **📁 FILES TO CHECK**
- `src/pages/EventCreation.tsx` - Main event creation page
- `src/components/Events/CreateEventForm.tsx` - Event form component
- `src/components/Events/PublishEventButton.tsx` - Publish button
- Event-related API calls and auth middleware
- Supabase RLS policies for events table

## **✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**
1. Authenticated user navigates to event creation
2. Fills out event form completely
3. Clicks "Publish Event" button
4. Event saves successfully to database
5. User receives success confirmation
6. No authentication errors during the flow

## **🔧 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**
1. **Check auth state in event creation:**
   - Verify `useAuth` hook is working in event components
   - Ensure user session is available during event creation
   - Check if auth state is properly passed to child components

2. **Verify Supabase RLS policies:**
   - Check `events` table RLS policies
   - Ensure authenticated users can INSERT events
   - Verify user role permissions for event creation

3. **Debug event creation flow:**
   - Add logging to track where auth fails
   - Check API calls for proper auth headers
   - Verify Supabase client configuration

4. **Fix notification system:**
   - Ensure error notifications auto-dismiss
   - Add proper success notifications
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

## **🔍 DEBUGGING STEPS**
1. **Check authentication state:**
   ```javascript
   console.log('User auth state:', user)
   console.log('Session:', session)
   ```

2. **Check Supabase RLS policies:**
   - Review policies in Supabase dashboard
   - Test policies with SQL queries
   - Verify user roles are set correctly

3. **Test API calls:**
   - Check network tab for failed requests
   - Verify auth headers are included
   - Test direct Supabase calls

## **🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Log in with Google account (after P1.1 is fixed)
2. Navigate to event creation page
3. Fill out complete event form:
   - Event title
   - Description
   - Date/time
   - Venue/location
   - Ticket information
4. Click "Publish Event"
5. Verify event appears in database
6. Check for success notification
7. Test with different user roles

## **📋 DEFINITION OF DONE**
- [ ] No authentication errors when publishing events
- [ ] Events save successfully to Supabase
- [ ] Success notification displays properly
- [ ] Error notifications auto-dismiss
- [ ] Works for all authenticated user roles
- [ ] Event data is complete and accurate
- [ ] No console errors during event creation
