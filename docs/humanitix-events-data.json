With over 1.3 million combined followers and a reputation for crossing lines others wouldn’t dare, Julian’s back on the road with a show even darker, bolder, and more twisted than before.</em></p><p><em>In ‘Cancel Me!’, Woods takes aim at everything and everyone, leaving no sacred cow untouched. This isn't just stand-up; it's a battle cry for the freedom to joke about whatever the hell he wants, no matter who gets triggered. And once the tour ends, this show is cancelled - for good!</em></p><p><em>If you want to experience the raw, unfiltered chaos of Julian Woods before he gets locked down by another 'cancel culture' attempt, you'd better get your tickets while you still can!</em></p><p><em>Brace yourself. This is comedy you won’t be able to forget. Coming soon to Australia, the UK and Ireland.</em></p>",
