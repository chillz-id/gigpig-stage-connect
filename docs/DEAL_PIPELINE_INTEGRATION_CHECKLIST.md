## üîÑ Next Steps (Before Production)

### 1. Database Setup
- [x] **COMPLETE** - Verified `deal_negotiations` table exists (45 columns)
- [x] **COMPLETE** - RLS policies verified and enabled:
  ```sql
  -- Users can view deals where they are involved
  CREATE POLICY "Users can view their deals" ON deal_negotiations
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = artist_id OR
    auth.uid() = promoter_id OR
    auth.uid() = assigned_to OR
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
      AND profiles.role IN ('admin', 'agency_manager')
    )
  );

  -- Users can update assigned deals
  CREATE POLICY "Users can update assigned deals" ON deal_negotiations
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    auth.uid() = assigned_to OR
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
      AND profiles.role IN ('admin', 'agency_manager')
    )
  );
  ```

### 2. Test Data Creation
- [x] **COMPLETE** - Created 10 sample deals in Supabase (see DEAL_PIPELINE_DATABASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.md)
- [x] **COMPLETE** - Verified relationships (artist, promoter, event) are working correctly
- [x] **COMPLETE** - Test data includes all 6 deal statuses (proposed: 2, negotiating: 2, counter_offered: 2, accepted: 2, declined: 1, expired: 1)
- [x] **COMPLETE** - Test data includes 5 deal types (booking, management, collaboration, endorsement, representation)

### 3. Manual Testing
- [ ] Navigate to `/crm/deals` (requires authentication + proper role)
- [ ] Verify kanban board renders with 6 columns
- [ ] Test drag-and-drop between columns
- [ ] Verify status updates in database
- [ ] Test search filter
- [ ] Test priority filter
- [ ] Test sort options
- [ ] Click deal card to open negotiation modal
- [ ] Verify modal shows existing `DealNegotiationEngine`
- [ ] Navigate to deal detail page
- [ ] Verify full negotiation history displays

### 4. CRM Sidebar Integration
- [x] **COMPLETE** - Navigation link already exists in CRMSidebar (line 159-163)
  - Link: `/crm/deals` labeled as "Active Deals"
  - Icon: Handshake icon
  - Active state highlighting implemented
- [x] Navigation from sidebar to deals page works (routing configured)
- [x] Active state highlighting verified (purple-600 background when active)

### 5. Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with 50+ deals
- [ ] Test with 100+ deals (may need virtualization)
- [ ] Measure time to interactive (TTI)
- [ ] Check for memory leaks during drag-and-drop

### 6. Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation through cards
- [ ] Screen reader support for deal status
- [ ] ARIA labels for drag-and-drop
- [ ] Focus management in modal
- [ ] High contrast mode

### 7. Mobile Testing
- [ ] Test responsive layout on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify kanban columns scroll horizontally
- [ ] Test touch gestures (note: drag-and-drop may not work on mobile)
- [ ] Test modal on mobile (should be full-screen)

### 8. Integration Testing
- [ ] Create deal ‚Üí Verify in database
- [ ] Update deal status ‚Üí Verify mutation works
- [ ] Open negotiation ‚Üí Send message ‚Üí Verify in `deal_messages`
- [ ] Filter deals ‚Üí Verify correct filtering
- [ ] Sort deals ‚Üí Verify correct ordering

## üìù Known Limitations

### Missing Features
- ‚ùå Deal creation flow (New Deal button has no handler)
- ‚ùå Bulk actions (select multiple deals)
- ‚ùå Deal duplication
- ‚ùå Export to CSV
- ‚ùå Advanced search (fuzzy matching)

### Performance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No pagination (loads all deals at once)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not tested with >100 deals
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No virtualization for large datasets

### Accessibility
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Drag-and-drop not keyboard accessible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No ARIA live regions for status updates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Screen reader support untested

### Mobile
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Drag-and-drop works on desktop only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Touch gestures not implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Touch targets could be larger

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot access /crm/deals"
**Cause**: User doesn't have required role
**Solution**: Ensure user has role: admin, agency_manager, promoter, or venue_manager

### "Deal not found"
**Cause**: RLS policy blocking access or deal doesn't exist
**Solution**: Check RLS policies, verify user is artist/promoter/assigned

### Drag-and-drop not working
**Cause**: Browser compatibility or event handler issue
**Solution**: Check console for errors, try different browser, verify event handlers

### Modal not opening
**Cause**: State management or component rendering issue
**Solution**: Check React DevTools for state, verify DealNegotiationEngine props

### Filters not working
**Cause**: Filter logic or state passing issue
**Solution**: Console.log filter values, check parent/child state passing

## üìä Metrics to Monitor

### Performance
- [ ] Page load time < 2s
- [ ] Time to interactive < 3s
- [ ] Drag-and-drop response time < 100ms
- [ ] Filter/sort response time < 200ms

### Errors
- [ ] No console errors during normal operation
- [ ] Graceful error handling for API failures
- [ ] Toast notifications for all user actions

### Usage
- [ ] Track number of deals created
- [ ] Track drag-and-drop interactions
- [ ] Track filter usage patterns
- [ ] Track modal open rate
