| Workflow | Purpose | Trigger | Frequency |
|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Complete Extraction** | Real-time partner invoicing data | Cron | Every 15 minutes |
| **Historical Import** | One-time complete data backfill | Manual | As needed |
| **Partner-Specific** | Targeted partner invoicing | Cron | Daily |
| **Manual Extraction** | On-demand event processing | Webhook | As requested |

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Events API → Ticket Types API → Orders API → Financial Processing → Partner Invoices
```

### Performance Specifications

- **Rate Limiting**: 1 second between API calls (configurable)

## 2. Financial Data Integration

### Revenue Calculation Formula

Based on analysis of 746 orders, the implemented formula is:

```javascript
Partner Share = Subtotal - Discounts - Refunds - Passed On Fees
Humanitix Share = Humanitix Fee + Booking Fee + Absorbed Fees
```

### Fee Structure Implementation

| Fee Type | Processing | Average | Notes |
|----------|------------|---------|-------|
| **Humanitix Fee** | Tracked | $3.00 | Revenue to Humanitix |
| **Booking Fee** | Tracked | $3.01 | Revenue to Humanitix |
| **Passed On Fee** | Deducted from Partner | $2.98 | 99.66% of fees |
| **Absorbed Fee** | Humanitix Revenue | $0.01 | 0.34% absorption rate |
| **Amex Fee** | Tracked | $0.02 | Additional card fees |

### Partner Revenue Metrics

- **Total Partner Revenue**: $24,142.07 (74.3% of gross)
- **Average Partner Share per Order**: $32.36
