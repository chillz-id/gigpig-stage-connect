# Ticket Sales Reconciliation System Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive ticket sales reconciliation system to ensure data accuracy between local database records and external platform data. This system provides automated discrepancy detection, resolution workflows, data integrity checks, and a management dashboard.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Reconciliation Service (`ticketReconciliationService.ts`)

**Purpose**: Main orchestrator for reconciliation operations

**Key Features**:
- Multi-platform reconciliation (Humanitix, Eventbrite)
- Automated discrepancy detection and resolution
- Configurable thresholds and rules
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Alert system for critical issues

**Core Methods**:
- `reconcileEvent()` - Reconcile all platforms for an event
- `findDiscrepancies()` - Detect data inconsistencies
- `resolveDiscrepancies()` - Auto-correct minor issues
- `getReconciliationStats()` - Generate performance metrics

### 2. Data Integrity Service (`dataIntegrityService.ts`)

**Purpose**: Ensures overall data consistency and quality

**Key Features**:
- 12+ predefined integrity rules
- Orphaned record detection
- Data validation (negative amounts, missing info)
- Consistency checks (totals mismatch)
- Duplicate detection and cleanup
- Backup and recovery capabilities

**Integrity Rules**:
- Orphaned ticket sales, applications, event spots
- Negative amounts and invalid quantities
- Missing customer information
- Invalid email formats
- Event/platform total mismatches
- Duplicate sales detection

### 3. Reconciliation Dashboard (`ReconciliationDashboard.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Administrative interface for monitoring and management

**Key Features**:
- Real-time sync health monitoring
- Discrepancy management interface
- Historical reconciliation reports
- Platform performance breakdown
- Manual resolution tools
- Export capabilities

**Dashboard Sections**:
- Overview: Stats, platform performance, health trends
- Discrepancies: Unresolved issues requiring attention
- History: Past reconciliation reports and outcomes

### 4. Custom Hooks (`useReconciliation.ts`)

**Purpose**: React state management for reconciliation features

**Key Features**:
- Real-time data fetching
- Automated background reconciliation
- Alert system integration
- Optimistic UI updates

## Discrepancy Detection Methods

### 1. Missing Sales Detection
- Compare platform orders with local sales records
- Identify orders present on platform but missing locally
- Auto-import capability for missing sales

- Configurable threshold for auto-correction ($0.01 default)
- Flag larger discrepancies for manual review

### 3. Duplicate Detection
- Identify duplicate orders by customer email and amount
- Time-window analysis (5-minute default)
- Safe removal keeping earliest record

### 4. Data Inconsistency Detection
- Orphaned records without valid references
- Invalid data formats and values
- Consistency between calculated and stored totals

## Database Schema
