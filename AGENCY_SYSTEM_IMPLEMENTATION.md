   - Business details (ABN, insurance, specialties)
   - Financial settings (commission rates, payment terms)

2. **manager_profiles** - Agency managers and their roles
   - Personal information and contact details
   - Role hierarchy (agency_owner, primary_manager, co_manager, assistant_manager)
   - Performance metrics and specializations
   - Permission and notification settings

3. **artist_management** - Artist-agency relationships
   - Contract details and commission rates
   - Performance tracking and revenue metrics
   - Territory and venue preferences

4. **deal_negotiations** - Deal negotiation tracking
   - Financial terms and performance details
   - Automated negotiation strategy and thresholds
   - Timeline management and deadline tracking
   - Priority classification and external references

5. **deal_messages** - Communication history

   - Response time and satisfaction metrics

### Enums and Types

- `agency_type`: talent_agency, booking_agency, management_company, hybrid
- `agency_status`: active, suspended, pending_verification, inactive
- `manager_role`: primary_manager, co_manager, assistant_manager, agency_owner
- `deal_status`: draft, proposed, negotiating, counter_offered, accepted, declined, expired
- `negotiation_stage`: initial, terms_discussion, financial_negotiation, final_review, contract_preparation

## Database Functions

### AI-Powered Functions

1. **calculate_negotiation_strategy()** - Generates AI-driven negotiation strategies
   - Analyzes artist performance history
   - Considers market data and positioning
   - Recommends negotiation approach (aggressive, conservative, balanced)
   - Sets automated response thresholds

2. **process_automated_deal_response()** - Handles automated negotiations
   - Evaluates offers against predefined thresholds
   - Automatically accepts, declines, or counter-offers
   - Creates appropriate response messages
   - Updates deal status accordingly

3. **update_agency_analytics()** - Calculates performance metrics
   - Tracks artist and deal statistics
   - Computes financial performance indicators
   - Measures response times and efficiency

4. **get_agency_dashboard_data()** - Provides comprehensive dashboard data
   - Recent deals and activity summaries
   - Top performing artists

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables implement comprehensive RLS policies:
- Agency owners have full access to their agencies

- Deal participants can access related negotiations
- Message access limited to deal participants

### Permission Functions

- `has_agency_permission()` - Checks user permissions within agencies
- `can_access_deal()` - Validates deal access rights

## TypeScript Integration
