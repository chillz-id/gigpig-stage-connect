## 🎯 Test Scenarios Validated

### PWA User Journey
1. User visits site → Install prompt appears after 10s ✅
2. User installs app → App opens in standalone mode ✅
3. User goes offline → Offline indicator appears ✅
4. User performs actions offline → Actions queued ✅
5. User goes online → Actions sync automatically ✅

### Invoice User Journey
1. User navigates to Profile → Invoices tab ✅
2. User clicks "Create New Invoice" → Form opens ✅
3. User fills form → Validation works ✅
4. User saves invoice → Invoice created with number ✅
5. Admin connects Xero → OAuth flow initiates ✅
6. Invoice syncs to Xero → Webhook updates status ✅

## 💪 Strengths
