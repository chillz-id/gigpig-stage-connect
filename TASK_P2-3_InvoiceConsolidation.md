# P2.3: Invoice System Consolidation

## **üéØ TASK OVERVIEW**
**Priority:** HIGH - User experience consistency
**Component:** Invoice management system
**Current Issue:** Two separate invoice pages causing confusion

## **üîç PROBLEM DETAILS**
- Dashboard/Invoices page exists separately
- Profile/Invoices page exists separately  
- Filter & search functionality only on Dashboard version
- Users are confused about which page to use
- Data inconsistency between views

## **üìÅ FILES TO CHECK**
- `src/pages/Dashboard/Invoices.tsx` - Dashboard invoice page
- `src/pages/Profile/Invoices.tsx` - Profile invoice page
- `src/components/Invoices/InvoiceList.tsx` - Shared invoice components
- `src/components/Invoices/InvoiceFilters.tsx` - Filter components
- Navigation components and routing

## **‚úÖ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**
1. Single unified invoice interface in Profile section
2. All filter and search functionality moved to Profile/Invoices
3. Dashboard/Invoices redirects to Profile/Invoices
4. Consistent data and functionality across all views
5. Navigation updated to point to unified location
6. No broken links or duplicate functionality

## **üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**
1. **Consolidate components:**
   - Move all invoice functionality to Profile section

   - Ensure all invoice actions work in new location

2. **Update routing:**

## **üîç MIGRATION STRATEGY**
1. **Phase 1: Enhance Profile/Invoices**
   ```typescript

   // src/pages/Profile/Invoices.tsx
   import { InvoiceFilters } from '@/components/Invoices/InvoiceFilters'
   import { InvoiceSearch } from '@/components/Invoices/InvoiceSearch'
   
   // Ensure all Dashboard invoice features are included
   ```

2. **Phase 2: Redirect Dashboard route**
   ```typescript
   // src/App.tsx or routing config
   <Route path="/dashboard/invoices" element={<Navigate to="/profile/invoices" replace />} />
   ```

3. **Phase 3: Update navigation**
   ```typescript
   // Update all navigation components
   // Remove Dashboard/Invoices menu item
   // Ensure Profile/Invoices is prominent
   ```

## **üé® UI/UX REQUIREMENTS**
1. **Unified interface features:**
   - Filter by status (Pending, Paid, Overdue)
   - Date range filtering  
   - Search by client/event name
   - Sort by date, amount, status
   - Pagination for large lists

2. **Filter functionality to migrate:**
   - Status filters (Pending, Paid, Overdue)
   - Date range picker

   - Client/event search
   - Export filtered results

3. **Navigation consistency:**

## **üìã COMPONENTS TO CONSOLIDATE**
```typescript
// Components to move/merge to Profile section:
- InvoiceFilters (from Dashboard)
- InvoiceSearch (from Dashboard)  
- InvoiceStats (revenue totals)
- InvoiceExport (PDF/CSV export)
- InvoiceActions (create, edit, delete)

// Ensure Profile/Invoices has:
- Complete filtering capability
- Search functionality
- Revenue summaries (Overdue | Pending | Total Revenue)
- All CRUD operations
```

## **üîó ROUTING UPDATES**
```typescript
// Update these routes:
'/dashboard/invoices' ‚Üí Redirect to '/profile/invoices'
'/dashboard/invoices/create' ‚Üí Redirect to '/profile/invoices/create'
'/dashboard/invoices/:id' ‚Üí Redirect to '/profile/invoices/:id'

// Update navigation:
Dashboard menu: Remove "Invoices" link
Profile menu: Ensure "Invoices" tab is prominent
Main navigation: Point invoice links to Profile section
```
